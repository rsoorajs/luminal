//! TestRuntime — the tests-side runtime vocabulary (rehoming ruling
//! 2026-08-13).
//!
//! THE SPLIT this crate exists to hold: the reference runtime is
//! functional, out-of-place and view-free. Its kernel table carries only
//! `*FunctionalDps` types and `reference_allow_list()` is *derived* from
//! that table, so a mutating or view-shaped op registered there is
//! extractable but can never be selected — dead weight paid for on every
//! saturation. The op shapes that exercise `Bufferizable` / `ToDps` /
//! the bufferizer's aliasing machinery live HERE instead, and this crate
//! owns them outright: instance, DPS form, matcher and `.egg` rewrites,
//! one folder per op under [`ops`].
//!
//! It depends on NO other runtime crate for its op vocabulary — not even
//! the reference one. The 22 plain functional ops are forked here too,
//! kernels omitted. These are two different runtimes with two different
//! jobs, and their vocabularies are EXPECTED to diverge: this op list
//! will be whittled down to the shapes the bufferizer contracts actually
//! need, while the reference registry moves toward
//! canonical-layout-only. Nothing is kept in sync on purpose.
//!
//! Egglog assembly is runtime-injectable
//! (`luminal::egglog_snippet::assembled_program_for`), so beyond that
//! this crate is a MATCHER LIST, its own op folders, and fixture
//! runners. It is plan-level only — no kernels, no executor: everything
//! it asserts is a property of an `ExtractedGraph` or a `BufferIrGraph`.
//!
//! The charter is about RUNTIMES ("anything it turns out to want from
//! another runtime gets REPLICATED here, never borrowed"); core is not
//! a runtime. [`extractor`] and [`sampler`] are core's e-graph walk and
//! genome sampler under this crate's old module names (#420/#422 rejoin
//! Phase 8, 2026-09-04 — both were verbatim copies here through Phases
//! 1-7). There is no selection loop either way: this runtime does not
//! execute plans, so it has nothing to price them with.

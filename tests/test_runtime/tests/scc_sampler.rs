//! THE SAMPLER-INVARIANT BOARDS on real e-graphs (ruling 2026-09-02).
//!
//! Genome sampling used to keep re-description candidates subordinate
//! by grouping index classes that instantiate the SAME LOGICAL VALUE
//! (the 2026-08-07 two-phase form, built for Copy⟷Copy layout welds).
//! It now groups them by STRONGLY CONNECTED COMPONENT of the candidate
//! graph, which is the mechanism itself: a choice cycle can only close
//! inside a component, whoever's logical value the members carry.
//!
//! Three boards here:
//!
//!  * `coverage_*` — the cross-check, in two halves. A FREE sampler
//!    (uniform over every candidate — the pre-2026-08-07 space) is run
//!    500 times and "the forest rule admits this genome" must agree
//!    EXACTLY with "its chosen-edge graph is acyclic"; then every
//!    component's candidate combinations are ENUMERATED and the set the
//!    forest sampler reaches is compared with the acyclic set. Equality
//!    is the two-sided claim: nothing cyclic survives, and nothing
//!    acyclic is eliminated.
//!
//!  * `marker_*` — the cuBLASLt double-transpose collapse on a 2D
//!    matmul, CPU-side. Its components hold members of DIFFERENT
//!    logical values, which is exactly what the same-logical-value
//!    grouping could not see.
//!
//!  * `union_*` — Austin's worked example. Inputs x, y, z; a = x + y;
//!    b = a - x; c = z + b; outputs (a, c) — then the recorded script
//!    is told what is true of it, `(union v7 v1)`: b IS y. The FINDING
//!    is recorded there: because b = y is a BOUND INPUT, and an
//!    input-terminal class is planned unconditionally, the weld is not
//!    a cycle at all and the sampler is free.
//!
//!  * `an_input_terminal_*` — the leaf rule itself (2026-09-02). The
//!    double-transpose collapse gives the marker's BOUND INPUTS
//!    producers of their own, and a zero-byte view used to win the
//!    input class on the `plan_label` tie-break — 11 of 64 sampled
//!    genomes then extracted a plan that computed an input from a value
//!    reading it back, which only bufferize's toposort caught. An input
//!    terminal is a leaf: no genome row, no candidate, and every sample
//!    reads it as a `BufferInput`.

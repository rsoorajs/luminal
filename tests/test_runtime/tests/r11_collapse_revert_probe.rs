//! ROUND-11 REVERT PROBE (permanent): the transpose sandwich needs a
//! termination anchor, and the probe pins that one is in force.
//!
//! The canonical-form sandwich mints a sibling whose operands are rank-2
//! transpose VIEWS, and the sibling is itself canonical, so the sandwich
//! fires on it too. Unless views-of-views union back into the original
//! tensor, each generation's views are NEW values and the main ruleset
//! never saturates (measured 2026-08-26 with no anchor: 3729 / 4616 /
//! 5386 / 6156 nodes at K = 40/60/80/100, ~38 nodes per iteration).
//!
//! Two anchors exist. The cuBLASLt estate's double-transpose collapse
//! rule (cublaslt_marker_canonicalize.egg) unions an apply-of-apply
//! transpose with its base directly. Core's `LogicalHelperMatrixTranspose`
//! recognizer names every rank-2 transpose view, and its involution rule
//! unions a transpose of a transpose with the base, so core anchors the
//! sandwich on its own. The probe runs a BOUNDED schedule ((run-schedule
//! (repeat K (seq (run) (run backend) (run prop))))) at increasing K WITH
//! and WITHOUT the collapse rule
//! (removed by exact string surgery on the assembled program) and
//! requires both to reach the same flat node count inside the range: the
//! collapse rule is redundant, and if this ever grows again the anchor
//! has been lost.

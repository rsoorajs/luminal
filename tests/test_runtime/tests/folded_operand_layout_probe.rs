//! FOLDED-OPERAND LAYOUT PIN (was `phase3_composed_access_probe`).
//!
//! The Phase-3 machinery this file pinned — `ComposedAccess`, per-slot hop
//! chains, `parent_dims` — is DELETED (corrected contract, 2026-08-31).
//! The reason is stated on `SlotDescriptor`: recording per-slot view-fold
//! chains was the PLANNER composing layout knowledge, and the e-graph
//! already mints every view value's composed layout at view creation. The
//! runtime's decoded `L` for that value IS the read path.
//!
//! So the plan-level fact worth pinning changed shape. It is no longer
//! "the fold's map survived onto the descriptor"; it is:
//!
//!   * the consumer's operand descriptor names the VIEW value while
//!     residing in the PARENT's buffer (the fold's redirect), and
//!   * it carries the VIEW's own elected layout — a different function
//!     from the parent's, over the same bytes.
//!
//! That second point is the whole content of the old hop chain, now held
//! in one opaque value the planner transports and never interprets.
//!
//! ASSERTION DISCIPLINE. These plans are built with `MockLayout`, which
//! transports the layout e-class IDENTITY and nothing evaluable — the
//! test runtime has no layout decoder of its own. Element-level
//! evaluation of REAL decoded layouts is pinned where real layouts
//! exist: `luminal_cuda_lite/tests/view_admission.rs` (searched plans,
//! flat-index evaluation against hand-computed maps) and
//! `test_runtime::test_equality` (readback through a returned
//! (buffer, layout) pair). Here we pin identity and distinctness.

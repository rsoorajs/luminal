//! The BufferTensor IR: the post-decision layer between analysis and the
//! erased buffer plan.
//!
//! A **BufferTensor** is a value paired with its assigned storage. Once the
//! conflict analysis has decided every tie and the assignment has given every
//! value a buffer, ops stop being value-level dataflow and become operations
//! over BufferTensors: each node consumes and produces (value, buffer) pairs.
//! The buffer plan ([`crate::bufferize::BufferIrGraph`]) is a *lowering* of
//! this IR — the "forgetting" step that erases the value half — and safety is
//! argued HERE, where both halves still exist, never after the erasure.
//!
//! This module hosts the layer's op surface (the trait an op presents once
//! every aliasing decision is behind it), the graph types, and the
//! construction from `(extracted program, analysis, assignment)`. The
//! lowering lives in `bufferize` beside the plan machinery it feeds.

///  * ALLOC CONVERSION: a poison-shaped op (no operands, every result
///    undefined) is the allocator's stand-in. On a program-minted (System)
///    buffer it BECOMES the [`BufferAlloc`] — same result residence, so the
///    dest edge it already feeds is the alloc→first-writer ordering. On
///    caller storage (an admitted seed) it folds to nothing: the caller owns
///    that allocation.
///  * BUFFER DCE: buffers no remaining node touches leave the buffer table
///    and the value_buffer map.
///  * ALLOC SYNTHESIS: a surviving System buffer whose first resident is a
///    DEFINED value (a retarget-copy target; a no-DPS result) gets a
///    synthesized [`BufferAlloc`] producing a fresh poison resident, placed
///    before the buffer's first toucher, with a Data edge to it — the same
///    poison-flows-to-its-overwriter shape as a DPS dest edge, minus the
///    named slot.
///  * FREE INSERTION (eager): every buffer whose deallocation is the
///    program's responsibility (`FreedBy::Program` — minted buffers except
///    ESCAPING ones, and donated boundary buffers) gets one [`BufferFree`]
///    consuming the
///    buffer's final written resident (or its Input-installed resident, if
///    nothing writes it), placed after the buffer's last toucher. Every
///    toucher not already ordered before the free gets an Anti edge into it
///    — and NOTHING ever points out of a free (out-degree zero, by
///    invariant), so later placement passes may move frees as freely as
///    their in-edges allow. An ESCAPING minted buffer (`FreedBy::Caller`,
///    flipped by the output residence split — ruling 2026-08-27) gets its
///    alloc and NO free: the caller manages the storage from return on.
///
/// The VIEW fold deliberately does NOT live here: a view is a value-level
/// distinction with no storage-level content, so "a view is nothing" only
/// becomes true once values are erased. It stays a lowering rule.
///
/// The rebuild preserves node order (allocs and frees slot in at their
/// placement points), so the lowering's emission order — and with it the
/// plan's printed schedule — reads allocate → use → free.

// The logical-SSA layout compiler. Egglog program assembly and registries live
// beside the ops; the fixture suite runs as core tests. See src/egglog_core/
// for the core preamble and fixtures.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE: post-saturation SELECTION. Each runtime owns the
// loop that chooses an implementation and everything that decides — the
// op registry, the allow list, the evaluator that prices a plan, the
// option knobs and outcome shape, the finalist policy:
// `luminal_reference::search`, `luminal_cuda_lite::search`.
//
// What core keeps is what decides nothing: the logical program, the
// egglog assembly, `dps_rewrite`, `layouts::decode_layout_table`,
// `bufferize`, the IR types — and, since #420/#422 rejoin Phase 8
// (2026-09-04), the two halves of search that make no choice:
//
//   [`extraction`]      — turning a genome into an `ExtractedGraph`.
//   [`search_support`]  — drawing genomes, plus the vocabulary a search
//                         reports itself in: `RefusalBreakdown`,
//                         `SearchTimings`, `SearchProgress`,
//                         `early_stop_exceeded`.
//
// Both left core in Phase 1 and were duplicated verbatim into the
// runtimes (three copies of the walk and the sampler, two of the
// reporting). Seven phases later the copies differed by one API-shape
// hunk and zero logic lines, so the ruling's own "maybe if there are
// some core utilities, they can belong in core" clause was taken. The
// runtime modules named `extractor` and `sampler` are aliases for
// these, and each runtime's `search` re-exports what it used to define.
//
// The line between the two sides is not "core vs runtime" but
// "describes vs decides". A genome is drawn the same way everywhere; a
// genome is PRICED differently everywhere, and pricing happens in the
// middle of the loop — which is why the loop is not here.

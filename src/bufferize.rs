//! Bufferization planner (one-shot-bufferization, in the spirit of MLIR).
//!
//! The [`ExtractedGraph`](crate::layout_ir::ExtractedGraph) is a single-valued
//! dataflow DAG whose interior `LayoutOp` values are *not yet backed by storage*,
//! and whose `BufferInput` / `BufferOutput` boundaries are already pinned to
//! caller-specified buffers. [`bufferize`] assigns a [`BufferId`] to *every*
//! value and lowers the graph — out of place, source untouched — to a
//! [`BufferIrGraph`] of storage events.
//!
//! # The conflict engine
//!
//! The analysis ([`Analyzer`]) walks ops bottom-up (MLIR's default heuristic)
//! and, for every operand an op *declares* an in-place candidate (a `Must`
//! edge in [`Bufferizable::alias_info`]), admits or rejects reuse (the DPS
//! rewrite pass
//! gives every built-in a destination-tied form, so real plans mix in-place
//! chains, seeded outputs, and out-of-place copies):
//!
//! * **Writability** — writing storage whose alias set includes a
//!   `Access::ReadOnly` binding is vetoed (`wouldCreateWriteToNonWritableBuffer`).
//! * **Read-after-write** — a read of any value aliasing the candidate must
//!   provably happen before the overwrite. Ordering is **DAG reachability**,
//!   never a chosen schedule: unordered ops are conservative conflicts, exactly
//!   like MLIR's dominance reasoning.
//! * **The same-USE exemption** — the candidate operand's own read never
//!   conflicts with its own write ("a use cannot conflict with itself"): a
//!   read-modify-write through one operand (an accumulator) is the canonical
//!   in-place case, its intra-op safety being the op's declared contract.
//! * **The cross-operand permit** — a same-op read through a *different*
//!   operand of aliasing storage is excused only by the op's own
//!   may-share permit (a `Sharing::May` edge in `alias_info`): unconditional
//!   and TRUSTED (the engine checks no layouts; ops discharge their
//!   preconditions at egglog match time). Cross-op reads are never excused
//!   this way.
//! * **Every rejection repairs** — a rejected tie's result gets its own
//!   fresh storage, initialized by the kernel's write (if the op writes it),
//!   preceded by a copy of the operand's bytes iff the result's pre-write
//!   contents must equal them (the op reads the operand, or writes nothing —
//!   a view). Every tie is repairable, so rejection is never an error.
//!
//! Cohabitation is sound because boundary values pinned to one buffer are
//! **pre-unioned** in the alias union-find (a prerequisite, not an
//! optimization). Undefined (poison) values are never READ at all: a program
//! in which any op reads an undefined operand, or any output slot binds an
//! undefined value, is rejected by [`validate_input_program`] as ill-formed —
//! so the conflict checks owe undefined contents nothing and carry no
//! exemptions. Undefined-ness remains a property of the *value*, never of
//! the buffer.
//!
//! # Rewrite
//!
//! Assignment gives equivalence classes their shared buffer (in-place) or fresh
//! system allocations. Rejected candidates get MLIR's `resolveConflicts`
//! treatment: the operand is **retargeted** to its tied result's fresh buffer,
//! with the old contents copied in first iff the op reads the operand. Output
//! slots materialize through boundary copies (skipped when the value already
//! lives in its destination), and every copy's overwrite is ordered after
//! unordered readers of its destination via **anti-dependency (WAR) edges**.
//!
//! The interface defaults still make every undeclared op fully out-of-place;
//! the DPS rewrite pass gives every built-in a destination-tied form, so real
//! plans mix in-place chains, seeded outputs, and copies. The unit tests
//! exercise every in-place path with mock ops; several are direct ports of
//! MLIR's `one-shot-bufferize-analysis.mlir` cases (non-writable function
//! args → the `Access::ReadOnly` tests). One deliberate DIVERGENCE from MLIR:
//! where MLIR exempts reads of undefined values (`read_of_undef`), we reject
//! the program in [`validate_input_program`] instead — undefined values are
//! write-targets only ([`test_support::EmptyOp`] tests pin the rejection).

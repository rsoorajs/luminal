//! THE EXTRACTOR — a core utility every runtime calls with its own
//! matcher list.
//!
//! It decides nothing. Given a saturated e-graph and a genome (a choice
//! of producer enode per e-class) it walks the graph and returns a
//! [`crate::layout_ir::ExtractedGraph`]; given no genome it reports the
//! space those genomes are drawn from (`producer_index`,
//! [`SamplingSpace`]). Its one runtime input is the op registry, and
//! that arrives as an argument of a core trait type
//! (`&[Box<dyn crate::layout_ir::OpMatcher>]`) — there is no runtime
//! type in this file, so there is nothing here to specialize.
//!
//! RUNTIME-SPECIFIC IS SELECTION, NOT THE WALK (#420/#422 rejoin Phase
//! 8, 2026-09-04). Each runtime keeps what chooses: its op registry,
//! its allow list, its evaluator (how a plan is priced), its option
//! knobs and outcome shape, its finalist/lattice policy, and the search
//! loop that runs them. This module and [`crate::search_support`] hold
//! the two halves that decide nothing — turning a genome into a graph,
//! and drawing genomes.
//!
//! History: the walk left core in Phase 1 ("move extractor.rs to each
//! runtime. Maybe if there are some core utilities, they can belong in
//! core, but for now just do a simple duplication in each runtime") and
//! was duplicated into `luminal_reference`, `luminal_cuda_lite` and
//! `test_runtime`. Seven phases later the three copies differed by one
//! API-shape hunk and zero logic lines, so the "maybe" clause was
//! taken: this is that one copy, in the borrowed-matcher form Phase 2
//! gave the CUDA-lite runtime. The runtime modules named `extractor`
//! are now aliases for this one.

/// `collect_input_terminals` seeds as `PlanKind::Input`, so the
/// invariant is "a class the plan reads as a launch-time leaf offers no
/// producer".
///
/// A boundary input is a leaf: it exists at launch. Sound unions can mint
/// producers in its class (for example double-transpose views), but no such

/// already drops every producer row of a class it seeds as an input

/// checked — so that an estate that marks an op the extractor still
/// plans as produced fails loudly rather than silently re-minting the
/// cycle.
///
/// The relation serializes like every other egglog fact: one node per

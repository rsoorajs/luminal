// =============================================================================
// The op interface
// =============================================================================
//
// A LayoutIR op is an open set: any type that implements [`LayoutIrOp`] can be a
// graph node. Every op is required to be [`Bufferizable`] (the type system
// enforces it — you cannot build a `dyn LayoutIrOp` that isn't), so the
// bufferization analysis can always query any op uniformly.

/// One aliasing declaration: how `operand` relates to `result`'s storage.
/// The op's whole aliasing contract — requirements AND permissions — lives
/// in one list ([`Bufferizable::alias_info`]).
///
/// `Sharing::Must` — a REQUIREMENT (a storage tie): the kernel's signature
/// demands `operand` and `result` be backed by one storage. Always honored
/// in every emitted plan; the analyzer's admit/reject decision selects only
/// WHERE that one storage lives — the operand's current home (admitted, zero
/// copy) or a fresh relocation (rejected — the generic repair: the result
/// gets its own buffer, initialized by the kernel's write if the op writes
/// it, preceded by a copy of the operand's bytes iff the result's pre-write
/// contents must equal them: the op reads the operand, or writes nothing at
/// all, as a view). Every tie is repairable, so rejection is never an error.
/// Must-edges form a PARTIAL MATCHING in ascending operand order (guarded
/// loudly at analysis entry — one allocation per storage class cannot
/// represent either-or aliasing or multi-destination results). What a tie
/// MEANS further derives from write effects: a written result is a dest tie
/// (descriptor-exact by the in-place convention; seeding crosses it), an
/// unwritten result is a view (derived storage under its own layout; seeding
/// never crosses it).
///
/// `Sharing::May` — a PERMISSION: reading through `operand` is safe even
/// while this op writes `result`'s storage in place (the two may alias).
/// Unconditional and TRUSTED — the engine checks no layouts; an op whose
/// safety depends on preconditions (equal layouts, injectivity) discharges
/// them where it is MATCHED (egglog) and only then declares the permit.
/// The ABSENCE of a permit is itself a declaration: `restrict` semantics —
/// the engine keeps the pair's storage disjoint by rejection + repair.
///
/// The edge universe is deliberately operand→result, and it is COMPLETE:
///  * operand↔operand permissions route through the written result — in
///    value SSA every write has a result, so "operand a may alias operand
///    b's storage" is `May(a → the result b is Must-tied to)`; read-read
///    aliasing needs no permission at all.
///  * peer-to-peer storage IDENTITY is expressed as dataflow, not edges:
///    two inputs that must arrive co-located are a Pack op's single packed
///    value; two results that share one underlying buffer are ONE
///    storage-producing result plus view ops over it (the resource is
///    reified as a value — the plan's native value/buffer split).

// =============================================================================
//
// Every op's definition has two halves with distinct lifetimes. The MATCHER
// half is registered up front: a zero-sized struct, one per egglog
// implementation constructor, that knows the constructor's name, which enode
// children are metadata, what the op contributes to the egglog program, and
// how to build a concrete instance from a matched enode. The INSTANCE half is
// what `extract` produces: the `Box<dyn LayoutIrOp>` that flows through
// bufferization, DPS rewriting, and rendering. Instances are created only by
// their matcher's `extract` (or derived from another instance via `to_dps`) —
// a hygiene convention, deliberately not enforced by privacy.
//
// The point of the split is that adding an op touches exactly one file: the
// op's module defines its instances, their trait impls, AND its matcher(s),
// and the only edit elsewhere is one line in the registration list
// ([`ops::built_in_matchers`]). There is no dispatch table anywhere — the
// extractor resolves candidates by looking the enode's constructor name up in
// a registry built from that list.

/// The two lookups the SERIALIZED e-graph does not carry, built once per
/// extraction session and handed to every [`ExtractionSite`]:
///
///  * BY CLASS — every e-node of an e-class, the inverse of
///    [`egraph_serialize::Node::eclass`].

/// `op ==`, so a reader's cost grew with the model rather than with the
/// class it read.

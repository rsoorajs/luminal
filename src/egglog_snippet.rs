//! Egglog program fragments as data, and the registry-driven assembler.
//!
//! The op surface of the egglog program — every `Logical*` constructor,
//! every `LayoutTensorOp*` implementation constructor, and every rule
//! associated with an op — lives ALONGSIDE the op that owns it: one `.egg`
//! file per rule, `include_str!`-ed by the op's `snippets()` (the
//! `LogicalOp` registry for logical ops, the `OpMatcher` registry for
//! implementations). The CORE preamble (`egglog_preamble.egg`) keeps
//! everything shared — the IntExpr machinery, layouts, buffers,
//! certificates, the coordinate machinery, the terminal stratum — plus ten
//! `;; @SPLICE <category>` anchor lines marking exactly where each
//! category of op contribution is inserted.
//!
//! Anchor positions are DECLARATION-ORDER-SAFE by construction: each
//! anchor sits after every core declaration its category's rules may
//! reference (the scatter-seed lesson: egglog resolves names top-down).
//! Within a category, contributions splice in registry-registration
//! order; rule order within a ruleset is fixpoint-irrelevant, so the
//! assembled program is semantically identical to the old monolith — the
//! byte-stable goldens are the proof.

/// Where in the core preamble a snippet is spliced. One variant per
/// `;; @SPLICE` anchor, in the anchors' file order.

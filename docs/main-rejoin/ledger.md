# main-rejoin ledger

One row per `main` post-split commit walked, in chronological order. The walk
lands each main commit onto `logical-ssa-project` at whatever fidelity the
branch's own decisions allow, and records — here — the ones that cannot be
carried as code, so nothing is silently dropped.

Dispositions:

- **FILE-LEVEL** — main's diff applied to the same paths, unchanged. Used for
  areas the branch parks rather than builds (`crates/luminal_python`,
  `crates/luminal_metal`, `ci/`, `spec.md`) and for the
  `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/` park, which TRACKS main's
  `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/` path-rewritten so the target CL must reach keeps
  moving.
- **RE-EXPRESSED** — the intent landed, spelled in the branch's vocabulary
  (`IntExpr`, `legacy_tracker_ref()`/`legacy_tracker_mut()`/`dims()`,
  coordinate-form gather/scatter, the pad family). A branch rename or decision
  is never reverted to make a main hunk apply.
- **INTENT-ONLY** — no code landed because the code main patched does not exist
  on the branch. The requirement is written out in the last column so it can be
  satisfied later against the branch's own machinery.
- **DROPPED** — deliberately not carried at all.

## #391 progress UI — re-expressed in `src/implementation_search.rs`

Main's diff patches the LLIR compile-search loop in `src/graph.rs` (main's
`Graph::search`, ~lines 2380–2660). That region does not exist on this branch:
the old HLIR search was deleted with `src/hlir.rs` / `src/op.rs`, and search now
lives in `src/implementation_search.rs` (a genetic search over the e-graph) plus
`src/extractor.rs`. Neither prints any live progress today, so there is nothing
to patch and nothing to re-spell — only a behaviour to record.

**What main prints, and when.** All of it is gated on one option:
`CompileOptions::search_log: bool` (default `true`), set by the builder
`.search_log(enabled)` and read through `log_channel_enabled(self.search_log,
"SEARCH_LOG")`, so the env var can override the programmatic setting. With it
off, the search prints nothing.

1. **`Start`** — once, before the loop, on the initial (baseline) genome:
   `   {:>6} {display}` with `Start` in bold cyan, followed by the progress bars
   (`render_bars(n_graphs, search_limit, bucket_progress)`) and an explicit
   stdout flush. This commit is what renamed that label from `Search` to
   `Start`: the first line reports the *baseline*, not a search result.
2. **`Faster`** — after any profiled candidate that beats the best-so-far:
   `   {:>6} {display_metric}` with `Faster` in bold green, carrying the new
   best metric. A `Faster` line is *permanent*: it is appended and the bars are
   redrawn beneath it, so a run leaves behind one line per improvement — the
   improvement history is the scrollback.
3. **`Slower x{n}`** — after any profiled candidate that does not beat the best:
   `   {:>6} x{n}` with `Slower` in bold yellow, where `n` is
   `slower_since_faster`, the count of consecutive non-improving candidates
   since the last improvement (reset to 0 on every `Faster`). A `Slower` line is
   *transient*: exactly one is ever on screen, replaced in place by the next
   `Slower`, and left to be overwritten/pushed by the next `Faster`.

**The cursor bookkeeping that makes 2 and 3 work.** Before printing, the cursor
walks up from the last progress bar to the first (`for _ in 1..n_bar_lines {
print!("\x1b[1A") }`); if a transient `Slower` line is currently visible *and*
this result is also slower, it walks up one more line so the new `Slower`
overwrites the old one; then `\r\x1b[2K` clears the line, the message is
printed, and `slower_line_visible = !new_best` records whether a transient line
now sits above the bars. The bars are re-rendered afterwards. Two bits of state
carry all of it: `slower_since_faster: usize` and `slower_line_visible: bool`.

**What landed here (ruling 5, 2026-09-02: match main).**
`ImplementationSearchOptions` gains `search_log: bool`, default `true` — main's
default, not the quieter one this row originally proposed — with the builder
`.search_log(enabled)` and the same env override, through a local
`log_channel_enabled(self.search_log, "SEARCH_LOG")` copied from main's
`src/egglog_utils/mod.rs` (this branch had no log-channel helper at all, so the
`LUMINAL_LOG=1` force-on and the `1/true/yes/on` flag parsing come across with
it). `search_implementations_with_runtime` builds a `SearchProgress` writer when
the channel is on, and reports on each PROFILED candidate (fingerprint-cache
hits are not candidates that ran, and can never improve the best): the first one
→ `Start` with the baseline metric; afterwards `nanos < *best_nanos` → a
permanent `Faster` line, otherwise the transient `Slower x{n}` counter, reset by
every improvement. Output goes to **stderr**, not main's stdout, so it never
contaminates a caller's data stream — and through a `CaptureAwareStderr`
adapter whose `Write::write` routes the bytes through `eprint!` rather than a
raw `Stderr` handle, because libtest's output capture intercepts the macro and
not the handle. Real runs print exactly as before; test runs are silent unless
`--nocapture`.

Two deliberate divergences from main, both console-only:

- **No cursor arithmetic.** Main walks the cursor up over its progress bars
  (`\x1b[1A` per bar row) before printing. This branch draws no bars, so that is
  dropped; the transient `Slower` line is written WITHOUT a newline and every
  later line begins by clearing it in place (`\r\x1b[2K`). A `Faster` line
  therefore replaces the pending `Slower` line instead of being appended below
  it, and `finish()` clears a still-pending one at the end of the search.
- **The harness stays quiet.** The DEFAULT matches main (`true`), and the suites
  are quiet anyway because the writer goes through the capture-aware macro; on
  top of that, `harness_search_options()` (`src/test_support.rs`) sets
  `search_log: false`, and so do the ten other struct-literal call sites the new
  field made exhaustive-literal-incomplete (all under `#[cfg(test)]`), so those
  searches do not even build a reporter. Nothing here rests on main's tests being
  noisy — main printed through `println!`, which libtest captures, so main's
  tests were silent too.

Unit test: `implementation_search::progress_tests::
progress_prints_start_once_faster_per_improvement_and_a_resetting_slower_counter`
drives the reporter over an in-memory writer and pins `Start` exactly once (with
the baseline metric), one `Faster` carrying the new best, the `x1 → x2` climb,
the reset back to `x1` after an improvement, and the five `\r\x1b[2K` in-place
rewrites. It strips ANSI so it passes whether or not `colored` colorizes.

## #386 early-stop profiling — what landed, and what is owed

Main's commit is one idea spread over six files: an opt-in
`CompileOptions::early_stop_factor(f64)` threads `Option<(best_metric, factor)>`
through `Runtime::profile` / `Runtime::profile_with_bucket_context`; each device
runtime, after every *timed* trial, compares the candidate's running MEAN trial
time against `best * factor` (the shared predicate `luminal::op::
early_stop_exceeded`) and breaks out, returning the partial mean. Selection is
explicitly unchanged: the truncated metric is still ranked, so early stop only
shortens the timing of candidates already out of contention. The initial genome
passes `None` because it *is* the baseline, and CUDA's warmup bail is left
untouched so a slow-warmup / fast-steady candidate is not disqualified.

**Landed FILE-LEVEL (parked, does not build):**

- `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/runtime.rs` — main's
  `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/` hunks with the path rewritten, per the ruling that
  the hlir park TRACKS main so the target CL must reach keeps moving. Applied
  cleanly against the park's existing branch drift (`IntExpr`, `alias_state` →
  `alloc_state_buffer` + `bind_*_buffer`, no `mask_events`); only hunk offsets
  moved.
- `crates/luminal_metal/src/runtime.rs` — file-level, per the ruling that metal
  becomes a runtime like the others and is ported later.

Both called `luminal::op::early_stop_exceeded`, which does not exist on this
branch (`src/op.rs` is deleted). Per ruling 6 (2026-09-02) that dangling
reference is gone: each park now carries a LOCAL `early_stop_exceeded` copied
verbatim from main's `src/op.rs` at 499d0779 (`crates/luminal_metal/src/
runtime.rs`, `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/runtime.rs`, each marked "local
stub: `luminal::op` does not exist on this branch; parks track main's
spelling"), and the call sites point at it. The parks keep main's spelling
without depending on a core symbol this branch does not have; the stub is
deleted when each crate is ported.

**Not landed (no counterpart on this branch):**

- `src/op.rs` (+41: the `Runtime::profile` / `profile_with_bucket_context`
  signature change, the `early_stop_exceeded` predicate, and its
  `#[cfg(test)] mod early_stop_tests`) and `src/hlir.rs` (+1: the
  `ReferenceRuntime` impl) — both files are deleted on this branch. The
  predicate and its test DID land, re-expressed, in
  `src/implementation_search.rs` (below); the `Runtime` trait they sat on
  did not, because it does not exist.
- `examples/llama/src/main.rs` (opts in at `.early_stop_factor(2.0)`) — this
  branch has no `examples/llama`; the zoo is `examples/llama3`,
  `examples/paged_llama3`, … and none of them use `CompileOptions`.
- `src/graph.rs` (+109: the `CompileOptions::early_stop_factor` builder, passing
  `None` for the initial genome and `Some((best, factor))` thereafter, and the
  regression test `search_passes_best_so_far_to_profile_early_stop`) — main's
  `src/graph.rs` is the HLIR `CompileOptions` / `Graph::search` file; this
  branch's `src/graph.rs` is the LogicalGraph recorder, with no
  `CompileOptions`, no search loop, no `trials` and no `timeout`.

**What was ruled, and what landed (2026-09-02).** The two decisions this row
was waiting on were taken, and the core re-expression landed in
`src/implementation_search.rs`:

1. **Which metric — ruling 2: the RUNNING MEAN.** `ReferenceProfiler`
   (`crates/luminal_reference/src/search.rs`) used to rank by the best-of-trials
   MINIMUM, which can still fall on a later trial, so truncating it is a
   heuristic that can flatter a candidate. It now sums the timed trials and
   returns `sum / trials` — a mean, which only rises as trials accumulate. Every
   reader of `best_nanos` is therefore reading a mean now; the re-baselining is
   recorded below.
2. **Where the cutoff hooks in — ruling 3: a FIFTH POSITIONAL ARGUMENT.**
   `PlanProfiler::profile` gains `best_so_far: Option<u128>` after
   `heuristic_cost` — not an options struct, for now. The selection loop passes
   `None` for the first profiled candidate (it IS the baseline) and
   `Some(best_nanos)` — the incumbent — for every later one.

**The core code, as landed.**

- `luminal::implementation_search::early_stop_exceeded(mean_nanos, best_nanos,
  factor)` — main's `src/op.rs` predicate retyped from `Duration` to u128 nanos,
  same comparison (`mean > best * factor`). The factor survives because it is
  main's semantics and main's device-tuning knob. There is NO
  `early_stop_factor` option on `ImplementationSearchOptions`: the cutoff is the
  bare incumbent (ruling 3), and the one in-core caller needs no margin.
- `ReferenceProfiler::profile` applies the predicate at `factor = 1.0` to a
  LOWER BOUND on
  the candidate's final mean — the trials run so far divided by the TOTAL trial
  count, i.e. assuming every remaining trial costs zero. Once even that bound
  exceeds the incumbent, no continuation of this candidate can win, so the stop
  is EXACT rather than heuristic: it never changes which candidate is selected,
  only how long the losers are timed. The partial mean (`sum / completed`) is
  returned and ranked normally, and is `>=` the bound, so it is still a loss.
- `StaticProfiler` accepts and ignores the argument (ruling 4): it runs no
  trials, so it has nothing to cut short. Note it lives in core
  (`src/implementation_search.rs`), not in `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/
  runtime.rs` — CL only *elects* it, at its one `search` call site.

**Tests.** `implementation_search::early_stop_tests::
early_stop_exceeded_keeps_mains_margin_semantics` is main's
`test_early_stop_exceeded` retyped (10 ms at a 2x cutoff is the boundary and
does NOT stop, 11 ms does, a faster-than-best candidate never stops, factor 1.0
stops anything slower than best), plus a tie case for the 1.0 factor the in-core
caller uses. `implementation_search::tests::
search_passes_the_incumbent_metric_to_every_later_profile_call` is main's
`search_passes_best_so_far_to_profile_early_stop` re-expressed: a recording
`PlanProfiler` over a real two-output search (fixed seed) that returns strictly
increasing metrics, asserting `None` for the first profile call and `Some(0)` —
the incumbent — for every later one.

**Re-baselining (mean vs min).** Nothing in the tree asserts an exact or
relative profiler figure, so no expectation changed:
`SearchOutcome::best_nanos` has exactly one reader outside the search loop,
`crates/luminal_nn/src/models.rs` (a `#[cfg(test)]` ladder that PRINTS
`outcome.best_nanos as f64 / 1e6` in its report row), and the loop's own
comparisons (`nanos < *best_nanos`) are metric-agnostic. What changed is the
MEANING: a plan's recorded cost is now its mean trial time, which for a noisy
host is larger and less spiky than the old minimum, and the search now prefers
consistently-fast plans over occasionally-fast ones.

**And the precondition that decides whether it is worth anything (ruling 4:
QUEUED, out of scope here).** The only profiler on this branch that actually
executes candidates is the host `ReferenceProfiler`, at `trials: 3` — a maximum
saving of two executes per losing candidate — and the search already suppresses
duplicate work with the plan-fingerprint cache. CL does not time candidates at
all: `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/runtime.rs` searches with `StaticProfiler`,
ranking by the heuristic bytes-moved cost with no execution. The requirement
carried forward, and the half of main's commit where this feature pays what the
PR claims: **CL must eventually profile on device, mirroring the reference
profiler's design** — warmup, timed trials, a mean metric, and the same
lower-bound cutoff — at which point `StaticProfiler`'s ignored argument becomes
a real one. That is a larger question than the cutoff itself, and it is not in
this batch.

**UPDATE (Phase 4, 2026-09-03).** The precondition above is discharged: CL
profiles candidates on device when `CompileOptions::profile_on_device` is set
(`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/profile.rs::profile_candidate`; `runtime.rs`'s
`search` builds `Evaluator::Device`), applying `early_stop_exceeded` at factor
1.0 to the same lower bound. The names in this section are HISTORICAL:
`PlanProfiler` / `StaticProfiler` / `ReferenceProfiler`,
`ImplementationSearchOptions::early_stop_factor` and
`src/implementation_search.rs` were all deleted in Phase 1, and
`search_passes_the_incumbent_metric_to_every_later_profile_call` was deleted
rather than moved (see the Phase 1 section, and finding C6 there for what that
leaves unpinned); the predicate stays pinned by `early_stop_tests` in each
runtime's own `search.rs` copy.

## #398 OpInfo + F64 — what landed, and what is owed

RULED 2026-09-02 (ruling 1): *"this is good and should get its content
merged"*. Split in two commits, because the commit is two things.

**FILE-LEVEL (commit 1).** All 13 `crates/luminal_python/**` files plus
`.github/workflows/test-python-native.yml` (the OpInfo shard job, committed
commented-out) take main's diff. The crate is not a workspace member here, so
none of it builds or runs; it is banked so the OpInfo harness — main's only
broad conformance oracle, 373 lines of `tests/test_opinfo.py` — is not lost,
and so the two genuine lowering fixes riding along are recorded as text:

- **`translate_arange` trusts export's output metadata** instead of
  recomputing `(end-start)/step`. The old code collected every *decodable*
  positional argument with a `filter_map`, which silently dropped float and
  bool values and shifted the survivors into the wrong start/end/step slots;
  the rewrite resolves `start`/`step` by PT2 schema NAME and takes the length
  from `output_meta_shape`, which is already correct for fractional and
  negative steps (`arange(-1, 2, 2)`) and for empty ranges.
- **`acos` / `acosh` lowerings** (Chebyshev-style polynomial + the
  `1 - x` square-root fold, and `log(x + sqrt(x^2 - 1))`) in
  `translator/unary.rs`.

Both are REQUIREMENTS on the M4 re-attachment: when the translator is
re-expressed against the recorder frontend they must not be silently
re-broken.

Four files conflicted and were resolved keeping this branch's spellings, never
main's (the standing rule): `compiled_graph.rs` takes main's new
`copy_host_bytes` helper but keeps the `IntExpr` doc comment;
`translator/attention.rs` takes main's f64 default SDPA scale with the
branch's `legacy_tracker_ref()` indentation; `translator/binary.rs` takes
main's `scalar_constant` + alpha plumbing with `expand_rhs(a.dims())` for
main's `expand_rhs(a.shape)`; `translator/tensor.rs` takes main's schema-name
arange with `Expr(IntExpr)` for `Expr(Expression)` and `indices.dims()` for
`indices.shape`. `main`'s new `Translator::scalar_constant` calls
`Graph::constant_float64`, which this branch does not have — a DANGLING
reference banked at main's spelling, the same standing cost as
`early_stop_exceeded` in the #386 parks.

**UNCARRIED.** `src/dyn_backend.rs` (+56) and `src/hlir.rs` (+240/-53) are
deleted on this branch and were dropped from the pick. `src/frontend/other.rs`
(+11) is live here but was not carried either: its whole hunk is the
`Graph::constant_float64` door, which is the `ConstantF64` question settled
below (SUPERSEDED). Of their content:

- The **`bytes_to_reference_data` empty-Vec dtype fix** is DROPPED, not owed:
  it repairs `ReferenceData::from_raw_parts` reinterpreting an empty byte
  slice as F32 regardless of the declared dtype. `TypedBuffer` holds typed
  `Vec`s and never reinterprets bytes, so the hazard cannot recur here.
- **`ConstantF64`** is SUPERSEDED and deliberately NOT ported. Main's own
  commit calls it temporary — *"should be removed ASAP once the SSA changeset
  lands, by having Constant be typed"* — and typed constants ARE this
  branch's design: `LogicalOp::Constant(f64)` already carries an f64 payload
  and `LogicalGraph::op` already takes an explicit `DType`. What blocks
  `Graph::constant_float64` today is one line of egglog, not an op:
  `src/logical_op/constant/dtype.egg` sets `(dtype-of (LogicalConstant ?v))`
  to `(F32)` UNCONDITIONALLY, so a constant cannot be minted at any other
  dtype. **Owed:** give `LogicalConstant` a dtype — either a second
  constructor child or a `dtype-of` seed written by the recorder — and then
  `constant_float64` is a three-line frontend method. Until then a parked
  `scalar_constant` call to it stays dangling.
- The **`f64_fn` arms** ARE re-expressed; see below.

**RE-EXPRESSED (commit 2): F64 as a real executable dtype.** Ruling 1
answered intent-row question 2 in the affirmative, so main's five `f64_fn`
kernel arms became a `TypedBuffer::F64(Vec<f64>)` variant and a typed unary
dispatch. The pieces:

- `TypedBuffer::F64(Vec<f64>)` in `src/buffer_tensor_ir.rs`, with `len`,
  `type_name` (`"f64"`), `as_f64` / `as_f64_mut` and `zeroed_like`.
  DELIBERATELY **no** `From<Vec<f64>>`, unlike F32/I32/I64: Rust's default
  float type is f64, so the moment that impl exists the staging spelling
  every test here uses — `vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0].into()`, unsuffixed — silently
  becomes an F64 buffer. Adding it turned 13 green tests red with
  "BufferLit(0) is F32; staged f64 data is the wrong type", and that is the
  BENIGN failure mode; the malignant one is an F64-annotated graph quietly
  accepting the same literals. A dtype must never change because a literal
  was unsuffixed, so F64 staging is spelled `TypedBuffer::F64(values)`, in
  full. (Bool8 has no `From` either, for its own reason: caller bytes must
  pass the validated two-legal-codes door.)
- `ReferenceKernelCtx::unary_elementwise_typed(f32_fn, f64_fn)` — main's
  `UnaryKernels` struct re-expressed. Main carried four fields (f32, f16,
  bf16, f64); this branch has no f16/bf16 storage, so it carries two, and an
  operand of any other type still refuses loudly by name. `unary_elementwise`
  (F32-only) stays for callers that mean F32 only.
- The six unary transcendental kernels take it: `sqrt`, `exp2`, `log2`,
  `sin`, `recip` — main's exact five — plus `exp`, which is branch-only (main
  spells it `exp2`) and is the same family, so leaving it F32-only would be
  an arbitrary hole.
- Storage and readback: the `PlanDtype::F64` arm in
  `ReferenceRuntime::materialize` (staged F64 accepted, zeros otherwise) and
  `ReferenceRuntime::get_f64`.
- **Arm inventory, so "executable" is read at its true width.** F64 executes
  through the unary family above, through `move_gathered` in
  `crates/luminal_reference/src/kernels/mod.rs` (gather, index-map
  materialize, dense layout copy), and through staging and readback. It has
  NO arm in `add`, `mul`, `less_than`, `reduce_sum`, `reduce_max`, `scatter`
  or `iota`; each refuses an F64 operand loudly by name at its catch-all.
  Main had those arms pre-split, via `ReferenceData::F64` in `src/hlir.rs`.
  **Owed** together with the cast policy in the next paragraph: an F64
  program today is unary-and-movement only. The reference BINDING needed no change — it
  emits `(bits-of (F64))` through the generic `{dtype:?}` arm, and the
  preamble already sets that row to 64.
- `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs` gains an F64 arm in
  `typed_to_bytes` so its exhaustive match stays exhaustive. The arm is
  `unreachable!`, not a transport path: `dtype_bytes` has no `PlanDtype::F64`
  row, so CL refuses an F64 buffer by name before the bridge is ever reached.
  Giving CL F64 *transport* without F64 *kernels* would be the half-done
  version, so it is not done. **Owed:** F64 on CL, if it is ever wanted, is a
  codegen question, not a storage one.

**Not carried: F32 <-> F64 casts.** The cast kernel gains no F64 arm, so an
F64 program must be F64 end to end. F32 -> F64 is an exact widening and would
be uncontroversial; F64 -> F32 is a lossy NARROWING, and this branch's cast
policy (2026-08-11) has a rule for float -> int (refuse) and for int -> float
(checked-exact) but says nothing about float -> float narrowing. Rather than
invent one in passing, both directions are left refusing by name at the
kernel's catch-all. **Owed:** a float-narrowing cast policy, and then the two
arms.

**No proof gate.** F64 is a float, and the non-wrapping ruling of 2026-08-11
gates Int and Int64 only — the ops' `match_functional.egg` non-Int arms are
spelled `(!= ?value_dtype (Int)) (!= ?value_dtype (Int64))`, so F64 mints
through them unchanged with no egglog edit at all.

**Test.** `luminal_reference::runtime::tests::f64_unary_round_trips_exactly`
is main's `reference_unary_ops_execute_f64_natively` re-expressed against the
branch's runtime: an F64 input through `sqrt` on the real search-and-execute
ladder, asserting BIT-EXACT equality against `f64::sqrt` on values whose f32
round trip is provably lossier (`2.0`, `3.0`, `0.1`, `1e300`), plus the
readback typed as `f64` via `get_f64`. `1e300` is the load-bearing one: it is
not representable in f32 at all, so the assertion fails outright if anything
in the path bridges through F32. The test also asserts that `get_f32` on
that output REFUSES ("expected an f32 buffer, found f64") rather than
narrowing.

Main's other two Rust tests do not move: `f64_constant_to_egglog_round_trips_exactly`
tests `ConstantF64`, which is superseded, and
`empty_bytes_preserve_reference_dtype` tests a `from_raw_parts` hazard that
does not exist here.

## #399 narrow ints — what landed, and the carve-out that needs confirming

RULED 2026-09-02 (ruling 2): *"this is good and should get its content
merged"*, with the narrow-int semantics flagged for Austin to object to at
review. Two commits.

**FILE-LEVEL (commit 1).** The seven `crates/luminal_python/**` files carry
main's diff byte for byte (no conflicts, no re-spelling — the diff-of-diffs
against `db3c80fd` is empty). `torch_dtype.rs` and `typed_data.rs` are the
boundary dtype tables — the record of which torch dtype maps to which luminal
one — and are worth having even inert. The crate is not a workspace member
and `typed_data.rs` still names `luminal::hlir::ReferenceData`, so none of it
builds; it is banked, not revived.

**UNCARRIED.** `src/hlir.rs` (+350) and `src/dyn_backend.rs` (+87) are deleted
here. Their content is re-expressed (below) except for the `DynBackend`
`get_output_i8/u8/i16` trait defaults, which have no counterpart at all: this
branch's outputs come back through `ReferenceRuntime`'s typed getters, so
main's three trait methods become three `get_*` methods on the runtime and the
`DynBackend`/pyo3/python reader-table plumbing around them is dropped with the
trait. Main's two test hunks (`src/hlir.rs` `mod tests`, `src/dyn_backend.rs`)
name deleted types and could not move as written; they are re-expressed as
reference-runtime tests instead.

**RE-EXPRESSED (commit 2): I8/U8/I16 become executable dtypes.** Ruling 2
answered intent-row questions 1-4. `TypedBuffer` gains
`I8(Vec<i8>) / U8(Vec<u8>) / I16(Vec<i16>)` with `len`, `type_name`, typed
accessors, `zeroed_like`, `From<Vec<i8>>` and `From<Vec<i16>>` — but NOT
`From<Vec<u8>>`, which is the payload type of both `U8` and `Bool8`, so an
impl would have to guess which one caller bytes mean. Kernel arms land in
`add`, `mul`, `less_than`, `scatter`, `reduce_sum`, `reduce_max`,
`trunc_div`, `trunc_rem`, `cast` and (through `move_gathered`) `gather`,
index-map materialize and the dense layout copy. `ReferenceRuntime` gains the
three `PlanDtype` materialize arms and `get_i8` / `get_u8` / `get_i16`.

> ### THE CARVE-OUT — Austin to confirm at review
>
> **I8, U8 and I16 arithmetic WRAPS at its own width, following main #399
> and torch. I32 and I64 keep the non-wrapping ruling of 2026-08-11: a

> call sites (`add`, `mul`, `reduce_sum`, `trunc_div`, `trunc_rem`, three
> widths each) and add `(I8)/(U8)/(I16)` proof gates beside the `(Int)` ones.

**Main's `as` casts: carried for integers, NOT for floats.** A cast touching
a narrow int routes through one `narrow_cast` helper in
`crates/luminal_reference/src/ops/cast/mod.rs` — five integer widths would
otherwise be 25 hand-written pair arms. Policy, stated once there:
int -> narrow int TRUNCATES (main's `as`); int -> `Int`/`Int64` stays CHECKED;
narrow int -> float is exact by width (|v| <= 32767, well inside f32's 2^24
bound), so the checked-exact rule has nothing left to check; `Bool8` -> narrow
int is the 0/1 indicator bridge. The ONE place main's `as` is not carried is
**float -> narrow int**, which stays a REFUSAL like every other float -> int:
the carve-out is about integer WIDTH semantics, not a licence to make a lossy
float read implicit. `GraphTensor::cast`'s authoring guard grows `I8|U8|I16`
so the author sees that refusal, not the search. (`I4`/`U4`/`U16` are left out
of the guard: they have no storage and no kernel, so a cast to them refuses at
the plan instead.)

**`Mod` vs `TruncRem`.** Main put its narrow arms on `Mod`. Integer remainder
is spelled `TruncRem` here (`Mod` is the f32 op, and says so in its refusal),
so `i8::wrapping_rem` / `u8: x % y` / `i16::wrapping_rem` land in
`ops/trunc_rem/`. `ops/modulo/` is unchanged and still f32-only. `trunc_div`
gets the matching `wrapping_div` arms, which main had no counterpart for. A
ZERO divisor still refuses loudly at every width: wrapping is a defined
result, division by zero is not.

**LIVE frontend: `abs` and `neg`.** `GraphTensor::abs` takes main's
dtype-aware body — identity for unsigned, `x * (1 - 2*(x < 0))` for signed —
and this is a genuine bug fix, not a refinement. The old body was
`self.relu() + (-self).relu()`, `relu` is `maximum_f32`, and `maximum_f32`
builds its bound with `constant_float(0.0).cast(self.dtype)`; an F32 -> Int
cast is REFUSED at authoring, so `abs()` on ANY integer PANICKED before it
recorded anything. Main's body is rebuilt from `Graph::constant` (Int)
instead of `constant_float` (F32) for the same reason. Landing it also
exposed that `impl Neg for GraphTensor` was dtype-aware for `Int | I64` only;
it now covers the whole integer family, and on an unsigned type the `-1`
constant casts to that type's all-ones code so the wrapping multiply is
two's-complement negation.

**Tests** (all in `crates/luminal_reference/src/runtime.rs` unless noted).
Main's two `src/hlir.rs` tests could not move — they name `ReferenceData` and
call `.execute()` on a bare op — so both are re-expressed end to end, through
the real recorder/search/execute ladder, which is strictly stronger:

- `narrow_int_add_wraps_at_its_own_width` — main's
  `reference_narrow_integer_add_wraps_in_declared_dtype`, same operands
  (`127 + 1`, `-128 + -1` at i8; `255 + 1`, `0 + 255` at u8; the i16 pair) and
  same expected wraps, read back through the non-widening getters.
- `narrow_int_casts_truncate_and_wide_casts_stay_checked` — main's
  `reference_narrow_integer_casts_preserve_native_widths`, the same
  nine-element `Int` source and the same three expected result vectors,
  plus a fourth act pinning that `I64 -> Int` still REFUSES out of range.
- `float_to_narrow_int_cast_is_refused_at_authoring` — the one deliberate
  divergence from main, pinned so it cannot drift back by accident.
- `integer_abs_executes_and_wraps_at_the_signed_minimum` — `abs` on I16
  (ungated) and on Int (attested range), with `abs(i16::MIN) == i16::MIN`,
  which is both the wrap and what torch reports.
- `luminal::frontend::unary::tests::unsigned_abs_is_the_identity` — `abs()`
  on U4/U8/U16 records no op at all.

Main's `src/dyn_backend.rs` test `narrow_integer_bytes_preserve_width_and_signedness`
does not move: it tests `bytes_to_reference_data`, a byte-reinterpretation
function with no counterpart under `TypedBuffer`.

**Not carried.** `U16` stays unmapped, exactly as in main — the dtype tag
exists, the storage does not. `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs` gets
`unreachable!` arms only: `dtype_bytes` has no narrow-int row, so CL refuses
them by name, and transport without kernels would be the half-done version.

## #394 CL executor persistence — the requirement main paid for

RULED 2026-09-02 (ruling 3): *"merge this into hlir version of cl and we'll
figure it out later"*.

**FILE-LEVEL.** The five `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/` files
(`runtime.rs` +989/-338, `kernel/to_host.rs` +300, `host/mod.rs`,
`host/flashinfer/mod.rs`, `dyn_backend.rs`) are path-rewritten into
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/` per the standing park policy — the park
TRACKS main so the target CL must eventually reach keeps moving. Every hunk
applied cleanly over the park's existing drift; there were no rejects. The
three `crates/luminal_python/**` files come along; `compiled_graph.rs`
conflicted only on the branch's `Expression` -> `IntExpr` rename in the
context around main's new `output_ids` field, and the branch spelling is
kept. Nothing here builds: neither crate is a workspace member.

**UNCARRIED — `src/dyn_backend.rs` (+14).** The file is deleted on this
branch. Its two additions, `DynBackend::clear_output_device_ptr` and a
default `copy_outputs_to_device_ptrs`, are the core seam of a capability CL
does not have at all, so they are recorded here as intent rather than code.

**THE REQUIREMENT, for the persistent executor CL now has (Phase 3, below).**
CL at this walk (before Phase 3, 2026-09-03) was single-shot:
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs` `execute_plan` allocated every buffer,
uploaded, launched, synchronized, downloaded, and dropped the storage —
strictly worse per invocation than main's runtime even BEFORE this commit.
Phase 3 has since made the context, stream, NVRTC module cache and
interior-buffer slab persistent; items 1-5 below remain unbuilt. What #394 is worth, in the order it would have to be rebuilt:

1. **Durable external pointer registration.** A caller-owned device pointer
   (a torch allocation) binds once; an identical re-registration is a NO-OP,
   not a rebuild of the pointer table.
2. **Exact binding deltas.** Track which HLIR/LLIR bindings actually changed
   and patch only the affected graph nodes, rather than re-materializing the
   whole captured graph per call.
3. **Reverse indexes built once** at construction: buffer -> kernel,
   dyn-dim -> kernel, output aliases, library buffer nodes.
4. **Resource-signature caching.** Validate hard resources by an aggregate
   signature so a repeated (even non-consecutive) shape configuration reuses
   the previous validation. Main's `HostOp::resource_buffer_nodes` exists so
   that ONLY inputs whose logical length a plan actually reads enter that
   signature; the branch analogue would live in the bufferizer if CL ever
   caches a device-memory plan.
5. **One terminal synchronize** for a batch of output writebacks
   (`copy_outputs_to_device_ptrs`), not one per output.

Two correctness rules from main's tests are worth having in writing NOW,
because they are the kind of thing a re-implementation gets wrong once each:

- An external output destination that **overlaps** a graph input but is not
  an explicit alias of it must be computed into the PLANNED buffer and copied
  afterwards, never bound directly (`device_ranges_overlap`, saturating
  arithmetic, zero-length is never an overlap).
- External-pointer inputs must **not** be consumed as one-shot buffers while
  runtime-owned ones are
  (`should_consume(is_external, preserved_for_output) = !preserved &&
  !is_external`), or a second invocation re-installs lifted weights.

**SUPERSEDED, do not port.** The positional-output half (`output_node_at`,
`set_output_device_ptr_at`, `get_output_*_at`) fixes duplicated output NAMES
losing identity. This branch's outputs are already a positional
`Vec<OutputSlot>` reached through `output_named`, so that defect is
structurally absent.

Main's eight `mod arena_plan_tests` unit tests cannot move — every field they
poke (`CudaRuntime`, `CompiledBucket`) is absent here. The two pure helpers
`device_ranges_overlap` and `should_consume_hlir_input` are ~15 lines and are

## #396 Symbol — parks tracked, core landed-by-equivalent

RULED 2026-09-02 (ruling 4): *"let's merge the content, we can resolve
later"*, with the CORE files explicitly NOT applied.

**CORE: LANDED-BY-EQUIVALENT, resolve later.** This branch landed the same
design independently and deliberately on the same day, as `90f687bf` ("Symbol
lands: string-backed validated dim names (our PR #396)", 2026-08-13). Same
contract — `Term::Var(Symbol)`, a Copy handle to an arbitrary-length name,
equality/hash/order BY NAME so backend slot assignment is a function of the
graph rather than of interning order — with a simpler mechanism: this branch
interns one leaked `&'static str` in a process-global map, so `Symbol` derives
Eq/Hash/Ord and there is no interior mutability inside map keys, which is why
it needs no `clippy.toml` `mutable_key_type` whitelist (main's arena version
does, and that is the `clippy.toml` hunk this commit does NOT take). Applying
main's `src/shape/{symbol,expression,tracker,mod}.rs`, `src/graph.rs`,
`src/op.rs`, `src/hlir.rs`, `src/dyn_backend.rs` and `src/egglog_utils/*`
would REGRESS the branch, not advance it; five of those files do not exist
here at all. The two headline bugs main fixes are already fixed here: the
extraction truncation (`name.chars().next()` turning `"s77"` into `'s'`) at
`src/egglog_core/egglog_utils/mod.rs:214-230`, and the 26-name pool overflow,
which cannot occur because names are strings. Main also reserves `"z"`; this
branch reserves nothing — `z` was retired 2026-08-06.

**FILE-LEVEL, into the parks.** `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/` (31 files)
path-rewritten into `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/`, plus
`crates/luminal_python` (7), `crates/luminal_metal` (6),
`crates/luminal_bench` (1) and `crates/luminal_training` (4). The training
crate is not named in the ruling's parenthetical list of parks; it is the same
kind of thing — a non-member crate — and its four hunks are one-line
`FxHashMap<char, usize>` -> `DynMap` retypings, so it is carried with the rest
and flagged here rather than silently dropped.

55 conflicts in the park and 17 in metal/python, all the same shape: the
branch's `Expression` -> `IntExpr` rename (A2 quarantine) meeting main's new
`Symbol`/`DynMap` types. Every one resolves to MAIN's content in the BRANCH's
spelling. Two needed more than that:

- `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/tests/flashinfer.rs` — main writes
  `named_tensor(name, dim).as_dtype(Int)`; `as_dtype` was DELETED here
  (frontend purity rulings 2026-07-30), so the branch's
  `named_tensor(name, dim, Int)` is kept with main's new `token_dim` /
  `context_dim` variables.
- `crates/luminal_metal/src/tests.rs` — main REPLACES its own test
  `dynamic_const_codegen_uses_dyn_buffer` with
  `dyn_slots_are_assigned_by_position_not_by_letter`, because the mechanism
  the old one tested (the `dyn[byte - b'a']` ABI) is what the commit deletes.
  Main's replacement is taken. Nothing is weakened here that this branch runs:
  metal is not a workspace member.

**UNCARRIED.** `clippy.toml` (+10) — a whitelist for a hazard the branch's
`Symbol` does not have. `examples/qwen/src/lib.rs` (+1/-1) — no such example
here; the branch has `examples/qwen3`, a different file, and the hunk is a
one-line `FxHashMap<char, usize>` -> `DynMap` signature change with no
counterpart.

**RE-EXPRESSED into live core: `Symbol::try_new_dim`.** Ruling 4 makes this
conditional on the banked PT2 remap actually referencing it, and it does —
`crates/luminal_python/rust/src/pt2_parser.rs` calls it twice. So
`src/shape/symbol.rs` gains the FALLIBLE door beside the panicking
`Symbol::new` (which now delegates to it, so the two report identically and
the existing `should_panic` test is untouched), plus an `InvalidSymbolName`
error type. Main's is a two-variant enum (`Malformed | Reserved`); this branch
reserves no name, so malformedness is the only failure and the type is a
struct. The point of the fallible door, written into its doc comment: a
frontend importing someone else's graph must be able to SEE a rejection and
remap, because DROPPING an unusable dim is the worst available outcome — a dim
absent from the symbol map never gets a value, so it freezes at the export
hint while the frontend, told it was dynamic, declines to recompile. Names are
still rejected, never sanitized. Test:
`luminal::shape::symbol::tests::try_new_dim_reports_instead_of_unwinding`.

**Requirements carried, for whenever these crates are re-attached.**

1. **PT2 remap** (`crates/luminal_python/rust/src/pt2_parser.rs`): keep
   torch's own name, remap to a COUNTED `pt2_dim_{n}` only when the name is
   unusable, never drop and never sanitize (sanitizing is not injective —
   `a.b` and `a-b` collide). The banked file now says this; the live door it
   needs (`try_new_dim`) exists as of this commit.
2. **Metal `dyn[]` slots** (`crates/luminal_metal/src/kernel/ops.rs`): the
   per-graph DISCOVERED slot layout replaces `dyn[byte - b'a']`. Under any
   scheme, a 27th dim writes past an unchecked pointer, so this is a
   soundness requirement on the metal re-attachment, not a cleanup.

## #400 dropped — and the state of the park it would have fixed

RULED 2026-09-02 (ruling 5): *"okay, we can drop"*. No code lands. The
row above is the whole disposition; this note exists so the reason survives,
and because the picture changed underneath the ruling.

**What the commit is.** Pure bookkeeping in main's own history. #396 converted
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite`'s dim-map keys from `char` to `Symbol`; #394 added
new `char`-keyed code at the same time; a squash-merge race meant #396's diff
never touched the lines #394 had just added, so 8 signatures were left
mismatched and the crate did not compile. #400 retypes those 8. No behaviour
changes and no capability arrives.

**Why it was still reasonable to drop.** At the time of the ruling the park
was a frozen pre-#396 snapshot: self-consistently `char`-keyed, with nothing
broken to fix, and the live CL crate has none of these functions (it uses
`match_functional.egg` matchers and `bufferize.rs` plans, not a `runtime.rs`
of this shape).

**What is true NOW, having applied #394 (P3) and #396 (P4) to the park.** The
park has inherited main's race exactly. Verified after this batch's earlier
commits, all in `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/`. Line numbers are as of
`e259d33d` (this row's commit); after #401 (P6) the four `src/runtime.rs`
rows below line 81 sit at 3079, 3080, 3099 and 5353, the `to_host.rs` rows
do not move:

| file | line | current | #400 would make it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/kernel/to_host.rs` | 496 | `kernel_users_by_dyn_dim: FxHashMap<char, Vec<usize>>` | `FxHashMap<Symbol, Vec<usize>>` |
| `src/kernel/to_host.rs` | 521 | same, at the local | `FxHashMap<Symbol, Vec<usize>>` |
| `src/kernel/to_host.rs` | 1370 | `dyn_map: &FxHashMap<char, usize>` | `&DynMap` |
| `src/runtime.rs` | 81 | `allocation_dyn_maps: Vec<Vec<(char, usize)>>` | `Vec<Vec<(Symbol, usize)>>` |
| `src/runtime.rs` | 2964 | `allocation_dyn_map: &FxHashMap<char, usize>` | `&DynMap` |
| `src/runtime.rs` | 2965 | `-> Vec<FxHashMap<char, usize>>` | `-> Vec<DynMap>` |
| `src/runtime.rs` | 2984 | `allocation_dyn_map: &FxHashMap<char, usize>` | `&DynMap` |
| `src/runtime.rs` | 5223 | `vec![vec![('a', a)]]` | `vec![vec![(Symbol::from('a'), a)]]` |

This costs nothing today — the park is not a workspace member and does not
compile for a dozen other reasons (it names `luminal::hlir`,
`luminal::dyn_backend`, `HostOp`, `as_dtype`, `persist`, `early_stop_exceeded`,
none of which exist here). It is recorded because "the park tracks main" is
the standing policy, and a park that has inherited main's compile break
without main's fix is a slightly worse mirror than one that has both. If the
ruling is revisited, applying it is one command:

```
git diff 2fbf5b6a^ 2fbf5b6a \
  | sed "s#crates/luminal_cuda_lite/#crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/#g" \
  | git apply -3
```

## #401 persistent arena — superseded by #422: one shared slab, and where it lands

RULED 2026-09-02 (ruling 6): *"just put this in the HLIR version and we'll
merge it later"*.

**FILE-LEVEL.** `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/runtime.rs` (+204/-74)
path-rewritten into `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/runtime.rs`. Applied
cleanly over the park's drift, including the three earlier commits of this
batch; every content line is main's, and the diff-of-diffs against `1d07093c`
is empty modulo hunk offsets. Not a workspace member, so nothing builds.

**What the commit does.** AT ITS OWN COMMIT: previously every bucket switch,
candidate load, profiling call and `clear_intermediate_buffers` FREED the
bucket's intermediate arena — a single big `CudaSlice<u8>` sub-divided by per-node
offsets — and the next bucket allocated a fresh one. Now a runtime-scoped
`PersistentArena { allocation, pool }` is PARKED instead of freed
(`park_bucket_arena` / `park_all_bucket_arenas`), only the LARGEST allocation
is kept (`retain_larger_arena`), and it is re-attached to the next active
bucket (`attach_persistent_arena`) only when that bucket's `arena_bytes != 0`.
A park discards graph-specific bindings only — cached buffer pointers, device
buffers, dirty-node sets, `hlir_synced` — while the device pointer survives.
`release_all_arenas` remains the true-free path, and
`intermediate_buffer_bytes` now counts the parked allocation too. All of this
is removed by #422 (`598e5ca7`): `PersistentArena` / `park_*` / `attach_*` /
`retain_larger_arena` deleted; replaced by `SharedArena` +
`ensure_shared_arena_capacity` + `bind_intermediate_buffers`;
`intermediate_buffer_bytes` = shared arena len; `clear_intermediate_buffers`
is a true free again.

**INTENT for CL.** AT ITS WALK the branch had NO analogue and, importantly,
had not yet reached the problem: `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs`
materialized one fresh `alloc_zeros` per `BufferId` per execute and treated the
plan's `BufferAlloc`/`BufferFree` nodes as explicit no-ops, and CL's search
ranked candidates by a device-free static prior, so it never churned device
arenas. When CL grows on-device candidate profiling or
bucketed re-execution, the re-expression is a persistent-allocation field on
`CudaRuntime` plus honouring `BufferAlloc`/`BufferFree` against ONE
runtime-owned high-water slab in `device.rs`, kept across `execute` calls
rather than dropped with the `storage` map (= #422's `SharedArena` form; if CL
ever profiles candidates on-device, decide explicitly whether to follow #422's
per-candidate free or #401's retention — they conflict).

DELIVERED 2026-09-03 — Phase 3 (`arena.rs` honours `BufferAlloc`/`BufferFree`
against one grow-only runtime-owned slab on the persistent `CudaDevice`) and
Phase 4 (on-device candidate profiling, which is exactly the trigger this
paragraph names; #422's per-candidate `release_slab()` is the policy chosen).

The transferable design, after #422:

(a) ONE runtime-owned slab (`SharedArena`) whose base is stable across bucket
switches; buckets hold non-owning views (`bound_arena_ptr`) — nothing is
parked or re-attached (#401 rules 1 and 3 were main's intermediate form,
superseded).
(b) Grow-only high-water sizing = max over retained bucket plans
(`ensure_shared_arena_capacity` / `peak_planned_arena_bytes`) — #401 rule 2 in
its serving form.
(c) Search is the exception: the arena is freed after every candidate and at
every bucket boundary (`release_search_candidate_allocations`,
`discard_search_bucket_compilation_state`) — #422 reverses #401's search-time
retention on purpose, because a losing candidate's arena "starves later
candidate compilation".
(d) A bucket with `arena_bytes == 0` contributes 0 to sizing and binds
nothing.

And one ordering discipline a naive re-expression WOULD drop: the free must be
enqueued stream-ordered BEFORE the memory pool is synchronized and trimmed
(still present at #422: `release_arena` `:671-676` -> `finish_arena_releases`
`:782-795`; growth additionally destroys every bucket's CUDA graphs and
synchronizes before the free, `:808-811`).

Main's one new test, `clear_parks_and_reattaches_the_same_persistent_arena`,
is DELETED by #422; its successors
`compiled_buckets_bind_different_layouts_to_one_shared_arena`
(`598e5ca7:runtime.rs:6151`) and
`search_cleanup_releases_candidate_arenas_and_bucket_state` (`:6217`) are
likewise device-gated and poke `rt.shared_arena` /
`compiled_buckets[i].arena_bytes` directly; nothing moves to CL. A branch-side
equivalent has to be written fresh against `device.rs` storage and would need
an A100.

## #404 spec.md — a snapshot of the OTHER architecture, landed as-is

RULED 2026-09-02 (ruling 7): *"this is just a snapshot, we'll update it
later"*. `spec.md` (128 lines) is taken byte for byte, unedited.

It is worth being precise about what it currently claims, because it is a
document a future reader will take at face value and it describes main's
pipeline, not this one. Its compile flow reads
`Frontend -> HLIR Graph -> Loop-rolled HLIR Graph -> Egglog Saturation ->
EGraph -> Extraction Search (genetic) -> Looped LLIR Graph -> Backend
Profiling -> unrolled LLIR -> Runtime`. On this branch:

- **There is no HLIR.** `src/hlir.rs` and `src/op.rs` are deleted. The
  frontend is the `GraphTensor` RECORDER (`src/graph.rs` + `src/frontend/*`)
  producing `LogicalOp`s directly; there is no translator stage and no
  HLIROp/EgglogOp/ReferenceOp trio.
- **There is no loop-rolling stage.** Structure reaches egglog through the
  logical ops' own `.egg` estates (`src/logical_op/*`), not through a rolled
  HLIR graph.
- **Extraction is not genetic-only, and does not produce LLIR.** AT
  2026-09-02: `src/extractor.rs` walks the e-graph to LayoutTensor ops,
  `src/implementation_search.rs` runs the search over them, and
  `src/bufferize.rs` lowers the winner to a `BufferIrGraph` of buffers and
  plan nodes. Since Phase 1 of the #420/#422 rejoin the extractor and the
  search are RUNTIME-OWNED — `luminal_reference::{extractor, search}`,
  `luminal_cuda_lite::{extractor, search}` — and only `bufferize` remains in
  core; see **Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 1**. "LLIR" names nothing
  here.
- **What IS still true**, and is the part worth keeping when the document is
  rewritten: semantic equivalence must hold across the whole search space; the
  reference runtime is CPU ground truth; and the program as authored is an
  unmodifiable statement of INTENT that the optimizer may only re-implement,
  never redefine.

**Owed:** a spec rewritten against the recorder / `egglog_core` /
runtime-owned `extractor` + `search` (per runtime crate, Phase 1) /
`bufferize` / CL flow — the shape already stated in the note at the top of
`spec.md`. Adapting this text line by line would be worse than starting from
the pipeline as it is; what should survive the rewrite is the contracts
section, not the diagram.

## #402 translate_module — the seam banked, the scatter fix superseded

RULED 2026-09-02 (ruling 8): *"I like your merge plan"* — the four
translate-seam files file-level, the `scatter_nd` half dropped as superseded.

**FILE-LEVEL.** `crates/luminal_python/rust/{Cargo.toml, src/lib.rs,
src/pt2_compiled_model.rs}` and `crates/luminal_python/src/luminal/pt2.py`,
applied cleanly (empty diff-of-diffs against `d6d26cbe` for those paths). The
commit adds a "translate and stop" entry point: `translate_module` traces and
exports a Dynamo `GraphModule`, translates the `.pt2` into a
`GraphTranslation` + `WeightData`, and hands that back in an unsendable
`TranslatedModule` pyclass INSTEAD of compiling a backend and returning a
callable. The packaging change is what makes that usable: the crate builds as
`rlib` alongside `cdylib` (lib renamed `luminal` -> `luminal_python`) and the
PT2 modules become `pub`, so a Rust host can LINK the translator rather than
drive it through the interpreter. Note the `#[pymodule]` is still `fn
luminal`, so the name Python imports is unchanged — the rename is safe exactly
as long as that stays true.

**The REQUIREMENT this banks**, for the python re-attachment: *an embedding
host must be able to take the translated graph without inheriting luminal's
dim buckets or its search budget.* `process_pt2` chooses both; a host that
wants to pick its own has nowhere to intervene. On this branch the natural
expression is handing back the recorded `Graph` (plus its `InputSpec` /
`output_named` bindings) BEFORE `implementation_search` runs — at which point
`GraphTranslation` itself has to be redefined in recorder terms, since it
currently carries HLIR `NodeIndex`es.

**SUPERSEDED — the `pt2_scatter_nd` fix, deliberately not ported.** Main's
bug: the per-trailing-dim `arange` scaffolding gave the tensor expanded
(0-stride) dims and then OVERWROTE its `ShapeTracker` with a contiguous
`[trailing_numel]` view, which is unsound for a virtual dim — at data rank >= 3
the scatter wrote one element per row. Main replaces it with
`flat_base.expand_dim(1, trailing_numel) + arange(trailing_numel).expand_dim(0,
batch_numel)`, which is correct because the trailing offsets happen to be
row-major over the trailing block.

This branch fixed the same defect independently and by a STRONGER mechanism,
in its own frontend: `src/frontend/movement.rs:563` `GraphTensor::scatter_nd`
computes the trailing offset as a real coordinate function —
`graph().iota(trailing_shape, |c| sum c[ti] * trailing_strides[ti])` over the
ACTUAL trailing strides, then `expand_rhs` / `expand_lhs` broadcasts (comments
cite ruling 2026-08-26, "ONE iota + two broadcast applies replace the per-dim
arange/expand scaffolding"). It does not rely on the trailing block being
row-major, it uses the strides. And main's buggy CONSTRUCT is not expressible
here at all: `legacy_tracker_mut` has no definition left anywhere in branch
`src/`, so there is no ShapeTracker to overwrite.

Porting the hunk into the parked file would create a second, divergent
spelling of a bug this branch already fixed, which a future reader could
mistake for the contract. Dropped.

Two bullets in main's own commit message — `DynBackend::move_buffer` and
`CudaRuntime::write_external` — describe code that is absent from main
entirely. Do not go looking for them.

## #405 OpInfo out of the Python CUDA job — one line, banked

One line of `.github/workflows/test-python-cuda.yml`, applied cleanly at
file level: the Modal pytest invocation gains `--ignore=tests/test_opinfo.py`.

This is the other half of #398. That commit banked main's OpInfo harness
(`crates/luminal_python/tests/test_opinfo.py`, ~6100 parametrized aten cases,
each of which compiles a graph) and the workflow that names it. Main then
discovered the cost: "Python CUDA Tests" runs the whole `tests/` directory
under a 120-minute job limit, and two consecutive main runs were cancelled at
the timeout, taking *every other* Python CUDA test down with them. The ignore
flag unblocks the rest of the suite.

**Why it is a pure bank here.** The job's triggers are `push` /
`pull_request_target` on `main` plus `workflow_dispatch`; it never fires for
this branch, and `crates/luminal_python` is not a workspace member, so no
pytest of any kind executes here. The line is carried so that the parked
workflow stays byte-identical to main's and the *reason* it is there survives
the park: without it, a future re-attachment that turns this workflow back on
would inherit main's timeout, not main's fix.

**What is still owed, and is main's problem as much as ours.** The OpInfo
cases now run nowhere. `test_opinfo.py` already supports sharding through
`LUMINAL_OPINFO_SHARD_INDEX` / `LUMINAL_OPINFO_SHARD_COUNT`, and #398 banked a
commented-out 32-way CPU shard job at `.github/workflows/test-python-native.yml`
line 95 — still commented out here. Giving the cases a home needs a decision
about which runner owns them, and, for the Modal path, a way to pass those two
variables into the container: `modal_pytest_runner.py` line 217 builds the
pytest environment as `os.environ.copy()` INSIDE `TestRunner.run`, a
`@modal.method()` executing in the Modal container (line 202,
`@app.cls(image=image, ...)`), so it copies the *container's* environment —
variables set on the GitHub runner never reach it. Both are requirements on the
M4 translator re-attachment, alongside #398's own.

## #403 int true division — banked, and the same trap exists here

`crates/luminal_python/rust/src/translator/{binary.rs, unary.rs}` take main's
diff unchanged. Both hunks applied 3-way with no conflict and the diff-of-diffs
against `ad437d8c` is EMPTY for both paths — unusually, this python commit
needed no re-spelling at all, because every symbol it reaches for already
exists here under main's name: `Translator::tensor_meta`
(`translator/mod.rs:160`), `torch_dtype_int_to_luminal` (`pt2_util.rs:216`,
reached through the `use crate::pt2_util::*` glob), `Node::outputs: Vec<TensorRef>`
and `TensorRef::as_tensor` (`pt2_schema.rs:39,50`), and `GraphTensor::dtype` as
a public field. Nothing in the hunk touches a `ShapeTracker`, a `.shape`, or an
`Expression`, which is why it escaped the usual three renames.

**What it fixes.** `ensure_same_dtype` implements `torch.promote_types`, which
is right for add/mul/sub — but ATen builds `div` with
`build_borrowing_binary_float_op`, whose config sets
`promote_integer_inputs_to_float(true)`, so `TensorIterator::compute_types`
rewrites an integral common dtype to `get_default_dtype()`. `int / int` is
float; `int * int` is int. Rather than reimplement that rule (the default dtype
is process-global, the rule includes bool, and `div.Tensor_mode` reverses it for
trunc/floor), main READS the answer torch already recorded: the exported program
carries a dtype for every intermediate, so `recorded_output_dtype(node)` pulls
the output dtype straight out of the node's `TensorMeta`.

The three paths, and why all three were needed: `a / b` with a tensor argument;
`x / 2`, which serializes as `div.Tensor` with an INT argument rather than
`div.Scalar` and so takes `translate_binary_op`'s scalar fallback; and
`translate_binary_scalar_op` proper. Main's message records patching the wrong
one first. The scalar routes cast their scalar to `a.dtype`, so promoting `a`
promotes both sides — hence the `self.promote_for_true_division(node, a, a).0`
spelling. And the promotion happens BEFORE the divide, never after: casting the
result is too late, because `Recip` has already been emitted on an integer.

The `unary.rs` half is a separate silent wrong answer, not the crash:
`div.Tensor_mode` with `rounding_mode=None` cast the float quotient back to
`a.dtype`, turning `3.5` into `3`. `rounding_mode=None` IS true division and
returns float, so the cast now goes to `recorded_output_dtype`, and to nothing
at all when export recorded none.

**The core-side observation, which is why this row carries an intent.** The
defect main hit is not a translator artifact — the identical lowering shape is
live on this branch:

- `src/frontend/binary.rs:119-125`, `impl Div<GraphTensor> for GraphTensor`, is
  `self * rhs.reciprocal()`.
- `src/frontend/unary.rs:116-128`, `GraphTensor::reciprocal`, records
  `LogicalOp::Recip` with `self.dtype` propagated UNCHANGED.
- `src/logical_op/recip/dtype.egg` propagates the input dtype to the output
  unconditionally, so an Int64 input yields an Int64 `LogicalRecip` class; no
  rule refuses it, and the search happily extracts it.
- The refusal lands at execution instead, in
  `ReferenceKernelCtx::unary_elementwise_typed` (`src/buffer_tensor_ir.rs:440`),
  which has an F32 arm and an F64 arm and bails by name on anything else:
  *"unary transcendental has no i64 arm (cast at the call site; a silent bridge
  through f32 would hide a precision change)"*. That is main's "unary opcode
  Recip does not support dtype Int64" in this branch's vocabulary — a LATER,
  louder failure at the same place in the pipeline.

So when the translator is re-attached at M4, the promotion has to be re-applied
at the same point (before the divide, reading export's recorded dtype), and it
cannot be recovered by casting the quotient. Whether `GraphTensor::div` itself
should promote integral operands is a SEPARATE frontend question and is NOT
settled by this row: the Rust operator is not obliged to follow torch's
process-global default-dtype rule, and the branch's own doctrine is that a
dtype never changes implicitly. What is settled is that a caller who divides
two Int64 tensors today gets a kernel refusal, not an answer.

**Not verified here.** Main's numbers — the five-path dtype/value table against
torch, Prompt-Guard-86M at cosine 1.0 / max abs diff 7e-06, mdeberta-v3-base
compiling — are main's, run against main's HLIR backend. `crates/luminal_python`
is not a workspace member on this branch, so none of it was rebuilt or rerun.

## #407 metal RMSNorm + simd reductions — banked, and what CL owes

`crates/luminal_metal/src/kernel/ops.rs` (+456/-32) and
`crates/luminal_metal/src/tests.rs` (+216) take main's diff. `luminal_metal` is
parked (not a workspace member, does not build here), and the branch's ONLY
delta to it since the split `325e2e3c` is two re-spellings — `Expression` ->
`IntExpr` (`ab3b5c66`) and, in `tests.rs` only, `as_dtype(dt)` ->
`tensor_dtyped(shape, dt)` (`cdeb73c7`, the purity ruling). Main's #396 and
#386 metal hunks were already banked in batch 3, so nothing else diverges.

**Residue.** `tests.rs`: EMPTY — main's new tests construct their tensors with
`cx.tensor(...)` and never touch `as_dtype`, so the purity re-spelling had
nothing to bite. `ops.rs`: 8 lines, every one of them `Expression` -> `IntExpr`
(6 added lines, 2 context). One conflict, at `lower_expression_for_metal`, where
main inserts `reduction_thread_count` immediately above a signature this branch
had already renamed; resolved by taking main's new function verbatim and keeping
`&IntExpr`.

**The rename reaches inside the egglog strings too**, which is worth stating
because it is not obvious. `ops.rs:428` is
`"(relation metal_rms_rinv (IR IR f64 Expression Expression))` — an egglog SORT
name inside a `Rule::raw` string, not a Rust type — and it was re-spelled to
`IntExpr` like the rest. That follows the park's own precedent: `ab3b5c66`,
the rename commit, rewrote
`crates/luminal_metal/src/memory_analysis.rs:44-45` from
`(relation metal_output_bytes (OpKind Expression))` to
`(OpKind IntExpr)`, sort name and all, and every `.rs` file in both the
`luminal_metal` and `luminal_cuda_lite_hlir` parks is uniformly `IntExpr`
today (`git grep -c '\bExpression\b' -- 'crates/luminal_*/**/*.rs'` on
`4ab3ce0c` returns nothing). Note the parks are NOT internally consistent about
this: the `.egg` FILES under `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/host/` still say
`Expression` (e.g. `cublaslt_output_witness.egg:23`). Nothing typechecks either
spelling here — the HLIR schema that declared the sort went with `src/hlir.rs`
— so the rule is simply to match the file's own crate, and for `.rs` that is
`IntExpr`.

### What the commit actually does

Two things, and the smaller one is the headline.

**1. `MetalRMSNorm`** — an egglog rewrite (`metal_rms_rinv`) that matches the
`x*x -> mean -> +eps -> rsqrt -> broadcast-mul -> *weight` chain and folds it
into one op, plus a fused shader with two code paths: a `float4`-vectorized
path guarded on `input/weight/output` ALL being `DType::F32` and
`cols % 1024 == 0` with `1 <= cols/1024 <= 4` (`ops.rs:586-593`), and a scalar
path for everything else. Six new tests, four of them REFUSAL tests
(`..._rejects_noncontiguous_input`, `..._rejects_dynamic_last_dimension`,
`..._rejects_mismatched_square_views`) — the rewrite is guarded, and the guards
are what the tests pin.

**2. `simd_sum` / `simd_max` block reductions** in the GENERIC `MetalSumReduce`
and `MetalMaxReduce` (`ops.rs:1425,1436,1608,1619`), replacing an 8-step
shared-memory tree (`for stride = 128; stride > 0; stride >>= 1`, a
`threadgroup_barrier` inside every step, 256 floats of threadgroup memory
written by every thread) with: one `simd_sum` per SIMD group — a hardware
reduction, no barrier — one lane-0 write per group into `partials[]`, ONE
barrier, then group 0 folds the handful of per-group partials with a strided
loop and one more `simd_sum`. Alongside it, `reduction_thread_count`
(`ops.rs:76`) sizes the threadgroup to the reduction length instead of always
launching 256: `min(reduction_len, aligned_limit)` rounded UP to a whole
multiple of `pipeline.thread_execution_width()`, where `aligned_limit` is
`max(256, simd_width)` clamped to `max_total_threads_per_threadgroup` and
floored to the SIMD width. The thread count then has to be passed into the
shader as buffer 4, because the strided load loop (`i += thread_count`) and the
partial-count arithmetic both depend on it.

### The CL intent this implies — verified against the live crate

`crates/luminal_metal` is a park, so nothing here executes. But the second half
is a strategy, not a Metal detail, and this branch's live CUDA backend does not
have it. Three findings, all checked in the tree at `4ab3ce0c`:

**(a) The live reduce is a serial per-output loop.** `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/kernels.rs:790`,
`pub(crate) fn reduce(...)`, whose own doc comment says it: *"Axis reduction,
axis zero-based FROM THE END (the DPS convention). One thread per output
element; the reduced extent is looped."* The emitted kernel is one
`for (unsigned long long r = 0; r < {extent}ULL; ++r) { ... acc = {fold}; }`
per output element, with `acc` a thread-local register. There is no warp-level
reduction anywhere in the crate: `grep -rn '__shfl|__syncthreads|__shared__|warpSize|cub::' crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/`
returns NOTHING. So a reduction over a long axis with few outputs — exactly the
RMSNorm shape, one row reduced to one scalar — runs on a single thread. Main's
strategy is CUDA-applicable essentially unchanged: `simd_sum` is
`__shfl_down_sync`/`__reduce_add_sync` over a 32-lane warp, the threadgroup
`partials[]` array is `__shared__`, `threadgroup_barrier` is `__syncthreads()`,
and `reduction_thread_count`'s SIMD-width alignment is warp alignment. THAT is
the larger half of this commit's value here, and it is owed to CL as a real
block-reduction `reduce`, not as an RMSNorm op.

**(b) No fused RMSNorm exists on CL.** `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/ops/`
holds: `add cast constant cublaslt div exp exp2 gather
index_map_apply_materialize index_map_apply_view iota less_than log2
materialize_layout_copy modulo mul recip reduce_max reduce_sum scatter sin
sqrt trunc_div trunc_rem`. An RMSNorm on CL today is that chain of primitives,
each with its own kernel launch and its own round trip to global memory. A
fused op is a legitimate future backend matcher — and per the standing doctrine
("backend matchers match exactly"), it would match the literal chain the
recorder emits, with the equivalence reasoning left to the general rules.

**(c) Two numeric notes that do NOT transfer unexamined.**

- The fused kernel accumulates in `float` and computes
  `rsqrt(total / float(cols) + eps)` in f32 REGARDLESS of the input dtype
  (`ops.rs:635-637` and `687-689`): `float sum`, `float total`,
  `threadgroup float partials[256]`, and `metal_numeric_read` converts each
  loaded element to `float` on the way in. For an f16 input that is an
  opmath UPGRADE — arguably the right answer, and the same thing torch's
  fused norms do — but it is a silent precision decision taken inside a
  backend kernel, and on this branch dtype is declared, never implied. A CL
  equivalent has to state its accumulation dtype rather than inherit one.
  Note also that the reduction ORDER changes: a strided partial sum per lane,
  then `simd_sum`, whose intra-warp order is unspecified. Float addition is not
  associative, and this branch's float-assoc rewrites are dtype-gated to
  Int/Int64 for exactly that reason — the kernel is free to do this (it is a
  backend implementation, not an e-graph rewrite), but it means the fused
  result is not bit-identical to the unfused chain. Main's own tolerances say
  so: `assert_close(..., 2e-4)`.
- `MetalRMSNorm::bytes_loaded` (`ops.rs:726-737`) reports
  `elements * inputs_per_element * 4`, where `inputs_per_element` is **2** on
  the vectorized path and **3** otherwise — a shader-path-dependent COST, and
  a fictional one either way (it prices `size_of::<f32>()` regardless of the
  actual dtype, and it prices the weight per output element rather than per
  row). This branch's cost model is different by ruling (2026-08-10,
  `src/extractor.rs:1684-1718`): `heuristic_cost` is bytes moved — operand
  bytes for every declared READ plus result bytes for every declared WRITE,
  with symbolic dims at the midpoint of their seeded interval bounds, computed
  from the layout's own extents and the element's real bit width. A CL fused
  RMSNorm would price itself through `candidate_heuristic_cost` from its
  declared reads and writes; it would NOT get to invent a per-element input
  count, and it would not get a different cost for choosing a different
  shader. Do not port `bytes_loaded`.

## #406 PyTorch lowering + complex dtypes — the largest split of the walk

Main's `62d3cc0d` is 38 files, +4833/-279: 24 in `crates/luminal_python`, one
new design doc, 7 in `crates/luminal_cuda_lite`, 4 in live core, one example,
one CI-adjacent default. It splits cleanly along this branch's own seams, so it
lands as two commits. **P4a landed; P4b landed — see the P4b subsection at the
end of this section.**

### FILE-LEVEL: the python park (24 files + `docs/design/associative-fold.md`)

Main's content, this branch's spellings, per the standing park rule. Six files
are new and came across verbatim: `translator/complex.rs` (1681 lines),
`tests/test_{binary,complex,constructors,reduction,straightforward_lowerings}.py`,
and `docs/design/associative-fold.md`.

**The headline is complex dtypes without a complex dtype.** `ComplexTensor` is
a pair of ordinary real tensors carried in a side map
(`Translator::complex_tensors`), never an HLIR/logical dtype — main's own
comment says so: *"Complex never becomes an HLIR dtype."* A complex INPUT
arrives as PyTorch's interleaved real/imaginary storage, so
`create_input_value` appends a trailing extent-2 axis to the declared shape,
mints ONE real-valued named tensor over it, and splits it into components with
`ComplexTensor::from_interleaved`; on the way out, `pack` re-interleaves. Every
real-only lowering path that is handed a complex name now refuses by name
(`get_tensor`: *"Complex tensor {name} reached a real-only lowering; add a
frontend complex lowering"*) instead of silently translating the real half.
That design — components in the frontend, interleaving only at the storage
boundary — is directly reusable here, and it is the right shape for this branch
too: it needs no new dtype, no new op, and no e-graph change.

Riding along: `output_meta_dtype(node)` (PT2 metadata is authoritative for
torch promotion, the same trick #403 used for true division), `constant_like`
replacing hand-rolled `constant_float(..).cast(..).expand_rhs(..)` chains
throughout `unary.rs`, `real_constructor_scalar` for the `*_like` family, and
`translate_diagonal` / `translate_flip`.

Four files conflicted; every resolution takes main's content in the branch's
spelling. `translator/mod.rs` takes main's `create_input_value` in all three
`InputKind` arms and its new `output_meta_dtype`, keeping
`named_tensor_dtyped(name, shape, dtype)` for main's
`named_tensor(name, shape).as_dtype(dtype)` (the `cdeb73c7` purity ruling) and
`Result<IntExpr>` on `dim_size_to_expr`. `movement_dynamic.rs` takes main's
`pub(super)` widening of `row_major_strides` at `&[IntExpr]`.
`translator/tensor.rs` takes main's `real_constructor_scalar`-based
`translate_full_like` whole (it replaces the branch's `constant_float(val)`
line). `translator/unary.rs` takes main's `constant_like`-based `real_acos`
whole.

**Residue** (diff-of-diffs against `62d3cc0d`, per file): fourteen of the
twenty-five files are EMPTY, including every `.py` file and the design doc.
The rest is exclusively the three known re-spellings —
`Expression` -> `IntExpr`, `X.shape` -> `X.legacy_tracker_ref()` /
`X.legacy_tracker_mut()` for tracker access and `X.dims()` where the shape is
passed BY VALUE to `expand_rhs` / `expand_to_shape_on_axes`, and
`named_tensor(..).as_dtype(dt)` -> `named_tensor_dtyped(.., dt)`. Line counts:
`complex.rs` 122, `movement.rs` 72, `mod.rs` 34, `tensor.rs` 24,
`movement_dynamic.rs` 24, `reduction.rs` 10, and 2 apiece in
`compiled_graph.rs` / `unary.rs` (hunk-header context only). Main's
`graph().iota(Expression::from('z'), shape)` is banked as
`IntExpr::from('z')`, matching the park's existing spelling at
`movement_dynamic.rs:51` and `tensor.rs:338` — and it is a DANGLING call either
way, because this branch's `Graph::iota` (`src/frontend/other.rs:35`) takes
`(shape, closure_over_coordinates)` and its doc says outright *"The old
flat-'z' interface is DELETED"*. That is the standing park cost, alongside
`Graph::constant_float64` from #398 and `early_stop_exceeded` from #386.

### FILE-LEVEL: 7 files into the `cuda_lite_hlir` park

`src/dyn_backend.rs`, `src/kernel/{hlir,rope,to_host}.rs`, `src/runtime.rs`,
`src/tests/{op_functional_tests,qwen_bf16_repro}.rs`, path-rewritten from
main's `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/` into `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/`. The
park TRACKS main's HLIR CUDA crate; this branch's live `crates/luminal_cuda_lite`
is a DIFFERENT crate (the CL backend) and none of this goes near it — `runtime.rs`
in particular exists in both and only the park's copy is touched.

Residue: `dyn_backend.rs`, `to_host.rs`, `op_functional_tests.rs` and
`qwen_bf16_repro.rs` are EMPTY. `hlir.rs` is one `Expression` -> `IntExpr`.
`rope.rs` is seven, all the same rename, six of them inside egglog `relation`
declarations — see the note under #407: in the parks' `.rs` files the sort name
is spelled `IntExpr` too, following `ab3b5c66`. `runtime.rs` differs only in
hunk-header line numbers (`@@ -611` vs `@@ -628`, and so on): the park's
`runtime.rs` has drifted ~18 lines from main's through the accumulated park
stubs (`early_stop_exceeded`, the `alloc_state_buffer` / `bind_*` drift), and
the CONTENT of all three hunks is identical.

One conflict, in `rope.rs`, at the head of the `angle_stage` egglog string:
main adds six new relations next to the one the park had already re-spelled.
Resolved to main's content, renamed.

### N/A — two paths that do not exist here

- **`examples/gemma4_moe/src/main.rs` (+1/-1)** — a comment update from
  *"(5s candidate / 1s execution)"* to *"(60s candidate ...)"*. This branch's
  `examples/gemma4_moe` has NO `src/main.rs`: it is `lib.rs` + `model.rs`,
  because model-zoo members here are backend-neutral graph definitions and the
  executables live under the runtime crate (`Cargo.toml`'s own comment).
  Nothing to patch.
- **`src/graph.rs` (+2/-2)** — the `CompileOptions::candidate_timeout` default
  moving 5s -> 60s, plus its doc. `CompileOptions` does not exist on this
  branch and `candidate_timeout` appears nowhere in `src/` or any live crate;
  `src/graph.rs` here is the RECORDER. The *intent* — a 5-second per-candidate
  viability budget is too tight once candidates are big — is worth remembering
  when `ImplementationSearchOptions` grows a timeout, but there is no field to
  move today.

### DROPPED-AS-INERT — `rowmajor-empty`

Main adds one line to `src/egglog_utils/base.rs`:

```rust
p.add_rule(rewrite("rowmajor-empty", rowmajor(nil()), nil()).ruleset("expr"));
```

The file is NOT deleted here, it MOVED: `src/egglog_core/egglog_utils/base.rs`,
and it is live — `base_expression_egglog()` is what
`IntegerExpression::egglog_equal` and the expression simplifier feed to egglog
(`src/shape/expression.rs:636`, `:1162`, `:1215`). The rule would apply
cleanly, and it closes a real hole in main's rowmajor recursion: the cons rule
handles lists of length >= 2, `rowmajor-base` handles length 1, and NOTHING
handled `RowMajor(ENil)` — a rank-0 shape, which is exactly what #406's new
scalar constructors produce a lot of.

It is not carried because on THIS branch it can never fire. `RowMajor` survives
only as a vestigial sort in the shared expression program: nothing in `src/`,
`crates/luminal_reference`, `crates/luminal_cuda_lite`, `crates/luminal_nn` or
`examples/` constructs one (`grep -rn RowMajor`, excluding `egglog_core` and the
parks, returns nothing), and `base_cleanup_egglog()` explicitly DELETES any
`RowMajor` node that appears (`src/egglog_core/egglog_utils/base.rs:1427`, in
the `sort_cleanups` table whose doc calls these "intermediate helper nodes").
Adding an unfireable rule to a program that is rebuilt and re-run on every
`egglog_equal` and every expression simplification is pure cost on a hot path.
**If `RowMajor` is ever revived as a live construct here, this rule comes with
it** — the hole it fixes is real, and it is a one-liner.

### RE-EXPRESSED (P4b): the two core changes, under rulings 4a and 4b

Main's remaining live-core hunks are `src/frontend/{binary,movement,other}.rs`.
Both went to Austin because both are decisions, not ports.

#### Ruling 4a — `GraphTensor::ne` returns `Bool` (option A, main's shape)

`src/frontend/binary.rs`. `ne` was the one comparison in the family that handed
back an F32 indicator: `lt` and `gt` record `LogicalOp::LessThan` at
`DType::Bool` and say so in a comment (*"Comparison operations always output
Bool"*), `le` and `ge` end in `.cast(DType::Bool)`, and `eq` ended in
`.cast(DType::Bool)` — but `ne` returned `lt.cast(F32) + gt.cast(F32)`, the raw
sum. It now casts, exactly as main does. `eq` no longer routes through `ne`: it
recomputes the numeric indicator inline, because going through `ne` would make a
Bool -> F32 round trip and force a backend without Bool storage to materialize
an otherwise internal boolean buffer. That comment is main's, and it is worth
keeping: the reason `eq` duplicates three tokens is a STORAGE argument, not a
style one.

**The call-site audit, in full.** `.ne(` has exactly THREE occurrences across
`src/`, `crates/luminal_reference`, `crates/luminal_cuda_lite`,
`crates/luminal_nn`, `examples/` and `tests/`:

| site | consumes the result as | change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/frontend/binary.rs:384` — inside `eq` | NUMBER (`-x + 1.0`) | REWRITTEN: `eq` computes its own indicator and never calls `ne` |
| `src/frontend/binary.rs:742` — `test_ne`, luminal side | NUMBER (already `.cast(DType::F32)`) | main's `assert_eq!(result.dtype, DType::Bool)` added before the cast |
| `src/frontend/binary.rs:743` — `test_ne`, candle side | candle's own `Tensor::ne` | untouched |

No consumer anywhere else — not a mask multiply, not a sum, not a reduction —
so nothing needed an inserted `.cast(DType::F32)`. That is the whole blast
radius, and it is the reason this ruling was cheap HERE and will not be cheap
the next time: the churn is small only because `ne` happened to have one
internal caller.

**LUM-803 — "Ideal value types vs machine dtypes: ops return
Integer/Boolean, the backing dtype is chosen later."** The `ne` -> Bool churn is
that ticket's motivating example. The question this ruling had to answer —
*does a comparison return a number you can multiply, or a truth value you must
convert?* — is a question about the frontend's TYPE, and it was being decided
one operator at a time by whichever cast happened to be at the end of the
expression. `ne` was inconsistent with `lt`/`gt`/`le`/`ge`/`eq` purely by
accident of how it was written. Under an ideal-value-type frontend, `ne` returns
Boolean because comparisons return Boolean, and whether that is stored as
`Bool8`, as an F32 0/1, or as a predicate the backend never materializes is a
LOWERING decision made later, once. Until then every such operator carries its
storage decision in its own signature, and every one of them is a separate
ruling.

#### Ruling 4b — NaN-safe `pad` via `select_by_index` (option i, main's construction)

`src/frontend/movement.rs`. **The bug, confirmed in this branch's own code
before the fix.** `pad`'s read half is a TOTAL CLAMPED VIEW: per parent axis
`min(max(c - before, 0), dim - 1)`, so the pad region does not read out of
bounds — it reads the nearest EDGE value and repeats it. The fill was then
applied arithmetically, `let masked = clamped * mask`, with `mask` 0 in the pad
region and 1 inside. For finite data that is correct. For a tensor containing
`NaN` or `Inf` on an edge it is not: `0.0 * NaN` is `NaN` and `0.0 * Inf` is
`NaN`, so a padded tensor's padding was poisoned by its own contents, and the
non-zero-fill branch (`masked + (1.0 - mask) * elem`) added the fill to that
NaN and stayed NaN.

**The construction.** `select_by_index(index, if_true, if_false)` selects
without arithmetic ever touching the unselected branch. Both branches are PACKED
into one buffer with a trailing extent-2 axis — `if_false` in the even slots,
`if_true` in the odd — and the branch the Int indicator names is gathered out.
Re-expressed on this branch's primitives, which is where it differs from main:

- Main's `graph.iota(Expression::from('z') * 2, shape)` is a FLAT-index iota,
  and that interface is deleted here (`src/frontend/other.rs:35`: *"The old
  flat-'z' interface is DELETED"*). The packed positions are instead a real
  COORDINATE FUNCTION over the branch shape — the row-major strides with every
  stride DOUBLED — passed to the rank-N `Graph::iota(shape, closure)`, the same
  idiom `scatter_nd` uses (ruling 2026-08-07, "no flat div/mod chain").
- Main's `.scatter(indexes, dest)` / `.gather(indexes)` are the branch's
  `scatter1d(indexes, dest)` / `gather1d(indexes)` — the flat sugar the B-tail
  landing added, whose argument order already matches main's. No new op was
  introduced.
- Main mints THREE iotas over the branch shape (`even`, `odd`, and a third
  `base` identical to `even`). This carries two: `even` IS the gather base, so
  it is reused rather than re-minted.

`pad_with(padding, elem: GraphTensor)` is the primitive, asserting the fill is
rank 0 and shares the input's dtype; `pad(padding, elem: f32)` is the
convenience wrapper, minting `constant_float(elem).cast(self.dtype)`. One
deliberate divergence from main: the all-zero-padding EARLY RETURN moved up into
`pad`, BEFORE the fill constant is minted. Main mints the constant first, which
would leave a dead constant node in the recorded graph for `pad((0,0), x)` —
harmless on main, but here zero padding must return a PURE-IDENTITY graph
(pinned by `stage4b_probes::pinned_pure_identity_output`, and the reason
`test_pad_1d` carries `prop_assume!(left + right > 0)`), and a stray constant
would no longer be one.

The mask now stays `DType::Int` — it is the select INDICATOR, not a factor —
where it used to be `.cast(self.dtype)` for the multiply.

**Tests pinned** (`src/frontend/movement.rs`):
`pad_fill_is_exact_beside_non_finite_values` pads `[1.0, NaN]`,
`[Inf, 2.0]` and `[-Inf, NaN]` by one on each side with fill 0 and asserts the
pad cells by BIT pattern (`to_bits() == 0.0f32.to_bits()`, so neither a NaN nor
a `-0.0` can pass) with the interior preserved NaN-for-NaN; and
`pad_with_uses_a_typed_scalar_fill` pads an Int tensor with `cx.constant(-7)`
and reads back `[-7, 1, 2, 3, -7, -7]` through `get_i32`.

**LUM-804 — "pad NaN-safety via scatter/gather select is a stopgap; a native
Bool8 select op is owed."** The cost is written into the helper's own doc
comment. Every pad now emits: one iota for the packed zero dest (twice the
output size, materialized), two scatters, one gather, one Int add, plus the two
coordinate iotas — where the old form was one multiply. It also FIGHTS the views
pad seam: the whole point of the clamped-`view_op` read half is that pad's read
is a structure-preserving VIEW the e-graph can fold with its neighbours, and
funnelling it through a gather over a 2N-element packed buffer materializes
exactly what that seam exists to avoid. A native `Bool8`-driven select — one
node, both branches read lazily, no packed buffer — collapses all of it and lets
the view survive. Until that op exists this is the only NaN-safe construction
available in the recorded vocabulary, and `luminal_nn::convolution` (`pad` at
`crates/luminal_nn/src/convolution.rs:115`), `concat_along`, `pad_along` and
`cumulative_*` all pay it.

#### `Graph::constant_i64` — LANDED, not superseded

The study question was whether this branch can already mint an exact `i64`
constant beyond 32 bits. **It cannot**, and the trace is exact:

1. `Graph::constant(impl Into<IntExpr>)` (`src/frontend/other.rs:5`) records a
   `LogicalIota` — `record_iota(&expr, &[])` — and declares `DType::Int`.
   `IntExpr` itself is fine: `Term::Num(i64)` (`src/shape/expression.rs:168`)
   and `impl From<i64> for IntegerExpression` (`:751`) carry the value exactly
   at the expression level.
2. But `src/logical_op/iota/dtype.egg` sets
   `(dtype-of (LogicalIota ?e ?shape))` to `(Int)` **unconditionally** — the
   same shape of pin as `LogicalConstant`'s `(F32)` pin recorded under #398 —
   and `DType::Int` is 32-bit (`src/dtype.rs:21`).
3. So the buffer is `TypedBuffer::I32`, and the reference iota kernel's I32 arm
   (`crates/luminal_reference/src/ops/iota/mod.rs`) does
   `i32::try_from(value)` and REFUSES by name: *"iota value {value} overflows
   i32 (ints are non-wrapping)"*. It does not silently truncate — this branch's
   non-wrapping ruling holds — but it does not produce the value either.
4. Casting afterwards cannot help: the narrow buffer already IS the value. The
   kernel has a perfectly good `TypedBuffer::I64` arm; nothing can reach it,
   because the dtype rule never says I64.

Main's Horner assembly is therefore the right shape here too, and lands
verbatim: each 16-bit limb fits `i32`, each is cast to `I64` FIRST, and all four
multiplies and adds happen in 64-bit. `i64::MIN` works because `value >> 48` is
`-32768` and the Horner chain reaches `-2^15 * 2^48 = -2^63` with no
intermediate outside `i64`. Test `constant_i64_preserves_full_width_values`
(`src/frontend/other.rs`) runs `[i64::MIN, -(1<<40)+7, -1, 0, 1<<40, i64::MAX]`
through `luminal_reference::harness::run_reference` and reads each back with
`get_i64` — main's test re-expressed against the reference runtime, since main's
version pokes `runtime.buffers` and `ReferenceData::I64`, neither of which
exists here.

**Owed** (the same debt #398 booked for `LogicalConstant`): give `LogicalIota` a
dtype instead of pinning `(Int)`, and `constant_i64` becomes
`constant(value).cast(DType::I64)` — one node instead of nine.

## #409 compile-time optimization — parked wholesale; the core ideas recorded

RULED 2026-09-03: *"move all this stuff to the hlir park and we'll get to it
later. We don't actually need to do much here."* Main's `b37eea15` is 33 files,
+5990/-4217, and it is main's biggest single compile-time push: a dense-integer
e-graph extraction index, a candidate prepare/profile split, cheaper topology
and alias validation, demand-gated cuBLASLt layout witnesses, and a
materialization fix. **Twenty-seven of the thirty-three files are backend files
this branch parks, and they went to the parks unchanged in substance. Nothing
landed in live core.**

### FILE-LEVEL: 26 files into the `cuda_lite_hlir` park

`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/**` path-rewritten to
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/**` at the same relative path, including
`Cargo.toml` (which gains `rustc-hash = "2.1.1"`) and
`examples/egglog_saturation.rs`. The park TRACKS main's HLIR CUDA crate; this
branch's live `crates/luminal_cuda_lite` is a DIFFERENT crate (the CL backend)
and none of this went near it.

What the 26 files carry, in main's own terms:

- **`src/kernel/to_host.rs` (+2169/-…, the largest)** — the CUDA-graph op grows
  reverse indexes it previously recomputed: `cublaslt_users_by_buffer`,
  `cublaslt_users_by_dyn_dim` and a precomputed `internal_buffer_dyn_dims`
  union, so a pointer or dimension change can name the affected kernels
  directly instead of asking every kernel for its dimension set. It also
  DELETES `extra_buffer_lifetimes` and `extra_buffer_conflicts` from the op
  (and `extra_buffer_conflicts` from the `HostOp` trait in `src/host/mod.rs`),
  the arena-refinement hooks that the new plan preparation makes redundant.
- **`src/resource.rs` (+602/-…)** — `validate_mutating_aliases` stops rebuilding
  an ancestor hash set per mutation and rescanning every edge. It now
  propagates two `u64` bitsets over the topological order — `reaches_mutation`
  (64 mutations at a time, in reverse topo order) and `includes_mutation`
  (along the alias-parent forest) — so every ancestor query is answered in a
  batch, `MUTATIONS_PER_BATCH` at a time. `validated_topology_and_aliases`
  gains a `LUMINAL_CUDA_PROFILE_STATIC_VALIDATION` timing channel, and fusion
  validation moves out of `validate_static_llir_semantics` into the new
  `prepare_static_llir_resources`.
- **`src/kernel/fusion/region_codegen.rs` (+1892/-…)** — late fusion matching is
  factored out and region source generation is cached behind a
  `RegionSourceCache` that `prepare_static_llir_resources` threads through, so
  a candidate's region source is generated once rather than once per
  validation pass.
- **`src/runtime.rs` (+1260/-…)** — `filter_llir_candidate` becomes
  `compile_and_validate_profile_candidate`, returning
  `Result<ValidatedProfileCandidate, CandidateFilterResult>` instead of a bare
  filter verdict: the candidate that survives the filter IS the compiled,
  resource-validated bucket set, and it is installed rather than recompiled for
  profiling. That is the backend half of the core `prepare_profile_candidate` /
  `profile_prepared_candidate` split recorded below.
- **`src/host/cublaslt/cublaslt_output_witness.egg` (+139/-…)** — the layout
  witnesses become DEMAND-GATED: `cublaslt_leading_dimension_request` /
  `cublaslt_matrix_stride_request` relations are asserted by consumers, and the
  `cublaslt_valid_leading_dimension` / `cublaslt_exact_matrix_stride` facts are
  only computed for requested pairs. `src/tests/cublaslt_rewrite_tests.rs` adds
  `cublaslt_layout_witnesses_are_consumer_demanded` to pin exactly that, and
  `src/host/flashinfer/flashinfer_attention.egg` (-1063 net) is a large
  contraction of the same kind.
- The remainder — `src/kernel/{conv2d,cuda_graph,fusion/elementwise,
  fusion/markers,generic_matmul,hlir,mod,moe_gemv,other_ops,rms_norm,rope,
  topk}.rs`, `src/host/{mod,cublaslt/mod}.rs`,
  `src/host/flashinfer/sink_attention.egg`,
  `src/tests/{dtype_contract,fusion}.rs`, `examples/egglog_saturation.rs` — is
  signature churn following those five, plus the Metal RMS late-fusion ruleset
  split (`kernel_fuse_late_pre` -> `kernel_fuse_late_pre_rms`).

**Conflicts and resolutions.** Five files conflicted, every one of them because
the park has DRIFTED from main's preimage in ways this walk deliberately keeps.
Each resolution takes main's content in the park's existing spelling:

| file | conflicts | why | resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/resource.rs` | 5 | the park drops `luminal::mask_events::*` (this branch deleted `src/mask_events.rs`) and spells `Expression` as `IntExpr` | main's postimage, `Expression` -> `IntExpr`, every `mask_events` statement dropped and the `toposort(..).map_err` closure collapsed back to one line, exactly as the park already had it |
| `src/kernel/fusion/region_codegen.rs` | 5 | `Expression` -> `IntExpr` only | main's postimage, renamed |
| `src/kernel/to_host.rs` | 3 | `IntExpr`, plus the #400 `char`-keyed dim maps the park deliberately keeps | main's content; `kernel_users_by_dyn_dim` stays `FxHashMap<char, Vec<usize>>` while main's NEW `cublaslt_users_by_dyn_dim` / `internal_buffer_dyn_dims` keep `Symbol` — i.e. the park still mirrors main's own #396/#394 race, which #400 (dropped, ruling 5 of 2026-09-02) would have repaired |
| `src/runtime.rs` | 1 | the `mask_events` drop again, in `compile_and_validate_profile_candidate` | main's content minus the two `RESOURCE_REJECT.record_with` calls |
| `src/tests/cublaslt_rewrite_tests.rs` | 1 | the park carries `Graph::tensor(shape, dtype)` (#452 in live core) | `cx.tensor(('m', k), DType::F32)` |

Main's newly ADDED lines were re-spelled the same way: two `IntExpr::from` in
`to_host.rs`, and the six `cx.tensor(..)` calls in the new
`cublaslt_layout_witnesses_are_consumer_demanded` test, which take
`DType::F32`.

**Residue** (diff-of-diffs against `b37eea15`, per file, path-rewritten).
Twelve of the twenty-six files are EMPTY: `Cargo.toml`, all three `.egg` files,
`src/host/{mod,cublaslt/mod}.rs`, `src/kernel/{cuda_graph,fusion/markers,
rms_norm}.rs`, `src/tests/{dtype_contract,fusion}.rs` and
`examples/egglog_saturation.rs`. The rest is exclusively the known
re-spellings; for the four files with new content it is verifiable more
strongly than by eye. **Drift-invariance check**: for every one of the 26
files, `diff(main preimage, park before)` and `diff(main postimage, park
after)` are the SAME set of lines — i.e. this commit changed the park by
exactly main's diff and added no new divergence — except in the four places
just named, where the delta is precisely the re-spelling of main's own added
lines. `src/runtime.rs`, the file with the most park drift, has 90 drift lines
before and the identical 90 after.

### FILE-LEVEL: 1 file into the metal park

`crates/luminal_metal/src/kernel/ops.rs` (+1/-1): `MetalRMSNorm`'s inverse
root-mean-square rule moves from ruleset `kernel_fuse_late_pre` to
`kernel_fuse_late_pre_rms`. Applied cleanly.

### N/A — `examples/llama`

`examples/llama/src/main.rs` (+1/-1), `SEARCH_TRIALS` 10 -> 3. There is no
`examples/llama` on this branch; the model zoo has `examples/llama3` and
`examples/llama3_1_fp8`, neither of which has that constant. Nothing to patch.

### UNCARRIED — five core files, and what each one is worth

Per the ruling, live core was not edited. What follows is the record.

**`src/egglog_utils/mod.rs` (+905/-67) — the dense-integer extraction index.**
Main introduces `LlirExtractor<'a>`: reusable state built ONCE per serialized
e-graph (op-name dispatch table, decoded expression metadata, per-class and
per-node caches) and then reused across the hundreds of candidates a search
extracts from that immutable e-graph. On top of it sits `IndexedChoiceSet`, a
compact genome of dense `DenseIndex` integers that `index_choice_set` converts
from the public `EGraphChoiceSet` once, so *"the compiler's hot search loop
never has to hash e-graph strings after the initial genome is converted"*;
`extract_indexed_packed` then extracts through integer-indexed e-classes into a
dense rolled representation, and `CachedIndexedExtraction` records the exact
selected bindings that can invalidate a cached immutable op so the hot path
validates with direct integer loads rather than re-walking an `OpKind` and its
`IList` term.

The branch's counterpart is `src/extractor.rs`, and it has already had the
first half of this idea landed for a different reason: PR #439 (`fe7ec9da`)
memoized the recursive `ClassRenderer` string rendering that was the extraction
wall, and `plan_fingerprint` (`src/extractor.rs:884`) dedups candidates. But
its caches are still keyed by `ClassId` / `NodeId` — `egraph_serialize` string
handles (`src/extractor.rs:6`), e.g. `memo: HashMap<ClassId, Option<Plan>>` —
so every memo probe on the hot path still hashes a string. **The dense-integer
index is the recorded follow-on to the render memo**, and it is the same
measurement that motivated both: per-genome cost is now dominated by
`bufferize` + `relax_to_fixpoint`, with extraction second. Landing it here
means interning `ClassId`/`NodeId` into dense indices once per e-graph and
re-keying `Extractor`'s memo, `tensor_bytes_cache` and stable-key memo on
those.

**`src/graph.rs` (+992/-407) — main's search driver, plus one real bug fix.**
`src/graph.rs` on this branch is the RECORDER (its own header: *"the old
layout-bearing HLIR graph and compile ladder are gone"*); main's is the compile
+ search driver. The hunks are not portable. One of them is worth naming
anyway: **the disjoint-loop Cartesian-product materialization fix.** Main's
loop materializer gave every node an instance for every loop region in the
graph, so N independent regions multiplied — main's own new test is
`materialize_many_disjoint_loops_without_a_global_cartesian_product`, whose
comment notes *"a global product would overflow at 2^64"*. The fix computes a
per-node `membership: u128` bitset of the regions that actually contain it and
keys the instance layout on that (`contexts_by_membership`), with
`checked_add`/`checked_mul` on the node and edge counts: *"Nodes only need
instances for the loops that contain them. Independent regions therefore remain
independent instead of contributing to a graph-wide Cartesian product. A
membership containing multiple regions represents genuine nesting, where the
product is semantically required."* **This branch has no loop-rolling stage at
all** — structure reaches egglog through the logical ops' own `.egg` estates —
so there is no materializer to fix. The invariant is the thing to keep: any
future instancing pass must scope instances to containment, not to the graph.

**`src/op.rs` (+49/-…) — the prepare/profile candidate split.** `Runtime` gains
`prepare_profile_candidate` (defaulting to `filter_llir_candidate`) and
`profile_prepared_candidate` (defaulting to `clear_intermediate_buffers` then
`profile` / `profile_with_bucket_context`), so *"backends whose hard filter
already compiles the LLIR can override both hooks to install that exact
compiled candidate and avoid compiling it again for profiling"*, with the
contract that *"a rejected candidate must not replace the currently loaded
executable"*. The same commit DELETES `Runtime::has_nan_outputs`. `src/op.rs`
does not exist on this branch. **This is a direct requirement on the owed CL
device profiler** (booked under #386, ruling 4): when a `PlanProfiler` that
times candidates on device is written, it should be given this two-hook shape
from the start — the CL backend compiles a plan to validate it, and profiling
it a second time from source would repeat that work.

**`src/mask_events.rs` (+6/-…)** — main retires `FUSION_REGION_REJECT` and
`NAN_OUTPUT_REJECT` (the counters whose checks this commit deleted) and drops
the `all()` array from 12 to 10. The file does not exist here; the branch
deleted the whole mask-events channel, which is exactly why every park file
that touches it carries the `mask_events`-free drift described above.

**`src/shape/expression.rs` (+26/-2) — the one hunk that would apply verbatim.**
Two of the three additions are useful and portable TODAY:

```rust
pub fn hash_intern_id<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) { self.terms.id().hash(state); }
pub fn has_same_intern_id(&self, other: &Self) -> bool { self.terms.id() == other.terms.id() }
```

`terms` is a `GenerationalBox` here as on main and `terms.id()` is already used
in this branch's own tests (`src/shape/expression.rs:1471`, `:1480`), so both
compile as written. They exist to let a caller hash or compare an expression by
its hash-consed identity instead of walking its term vector — the hot-path
concern the dense index above is built around. **Recorded as optional-later,
not landed**: nothing on this branch calls them yet, and adding public API to
`IntegerExpression` ahead of its first consumer is how dead surface
accumulates. The third addition, `collect_dyn_vars_into(&self, vars: &mut
FxHashSet<Symbol>)`, is DEAD here: it is the allocation-free counterpart to
`Expression::dyn_vars`, and `dyn_vars` was deleted from this branch by the
z-var retirement (`grep -rn 'dyn_vars' src/` returns nothing), along with
`Symbol::is_reserved` which its filter calls.

### N/A — the cuBLASLt zero-workspace fix

Main's `src/host/cublaslt/mod.rs` hunk makes the workspace `Arc`-shared and
recyclable, and guards the degenerate case: when `self._workspace.len() == 0`
it passes a NULL pointer and a zero size to `cublasLtMatmul` instead of a
dangling one. **The live CL crate cannot reach that state.** It owns a fixed
workspace — `const WORKSPACE_BYTES: usize = 32 * 1024 * 1024`
(`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/ops/cublaslt/device_call.rs:38`), allocated with
`alloc_zeros::<u8>(WORKSPACE_BYTES)` at `:291`, fed to the heuristic preference
at `:306` and passed to the matmul at `:376` — so the size is a compile-time
constant, never zero, and never derived from a per-spec `workspace_size` that
a heuristic could return as 0. The recycling half of the fix is a main-side
allocator concern with no counterpart here.

## #414 ATen coverage — banked in one go

RULED 2026-09-03: *"we can also do 414 in one go."* Main's `2f820521` is
23 files, +8134/-121, and 19 of them are the python park.

### FILE-LEVEL: 19 files in `crates/luminal_python`

Fourteen Rust files (two of them new — `translator/pooling.rs`, 928 lines, and
`translator/sampling.rs`, 314) and five pytest files (`test_fft.py` and
`test_remaining_existing_hlir_lowerings.py` new). Main's content, this
branch's spellings, per the standing park rule.

**What it adds.** Roughly 115 new `torch.ops.aten.*` overloads reach a
lowering, in recognizable families:

- **Elementwise + special functions** — `hypot`, `gcd`, `expm1`, `sinh`, `tan`,
  `log1p`, `log10`, `angle`, `isinf`, `signbit`, `hardtanh`, `elu`,
  `leaky_relu`, `round.default`/`round.decimals`, `erfc`, `erfinv`,
  `special_erfcx`, `lgamma`, `digamma`, `polygamma`, `i0`, and the whole Bessel
  / Chebyshev-polynomial / Airy / `ndtri` block. `erf` itself moves out of the
  giant `dispatch.rs` match arm into `translate_erf`.
- **Pooling and normalization** (`translator/pooling.rs`) — `avg_pool2d/3d`,
  `_adaptive_avg_pool2d/3d`, `max_pool2d/3d_with_indices` (+ the 2d backward),
  `adaptive_max_pool2d/3d`, `fractional_max_pool2d/3d`, `grid_sampler_2d/3d`,
  and the `_native_batch_norm_legit` / `_batch_norm_with_update_functional`
  family.
- **Reductions and statistics** — `var` / `var_mean` in all three overloads,
  `any.default/dim/dims`, `max.dim`, `min.dim`, `median`/`nanmedian`,
  `logcumsumexp`, `linalg_vector_norm`, `dist`, `_cdist_forward`,
  `_pdist_forward`, `_trilinear`, `segment_reduce`, and the `histogram` /
  `_histogramdd_*` set.
- **Scatter/gather with reductions** — `scatter.reduce`,
  `scatter.value_reduce`, `scatter_add`, `scatter_reduce.two`, `index_reduce`,
  `slice_scatter`, `masked_scatter`, `put`, `nonzero_static`,
  `embedding_renorm`, `_embedding_bag_forward_only`.
- **Sampling and sorting** (`translator/sampling.rs`) — `sort.default` and
  `sort.stable`.
- **Constructors and copies** — `empty.memory_format`, `empty_permuted`,
  `empty_strided`, `new_empty_strided`, `tril_indices`, `triu_indices`,
  `view_copy`, `permute_copy`, `narrow_copy`, `unbind_copy.int`,
  `upsample_bilinear2d.vec` and its antialiased form.

Two pieces of the mechanism are worth naming because they are reusable
requirements, not just op count. First, `translator/mod.rs` grows a
**by-name argument reader** — `named_input_index` / `named_int_arg` /
`named_float_arg` / `named_bool_arg` / `named_tensor_arg` — plus
`tensor_output_names` / `store_tensor_outputs` for multi-output ops and two
constructors (`axis_positions`, `full_tensor`). Main's own comment on the
`sort` change says why: *"`sort.stable` inserts a keyword-only `stable`
argument before dim, so resolve these by schema name rather than by
overload-dependent position."* Positional argument indices are not stable
across ATen overloads, and every lowering that used them was one overload away
from silently reading the wrong argument. Second, `reduce_scatter_elements` is
a **sequential read/modify/write** lowering shared by `scatter_reduce` and
`index_reduce`: core `Scatter` is overwrite-only, so preserving duplicate
update order needs one static graph step per update element, and a symbolic
update stream is padded to its compile-time upper bound
(`bounds_of_expr(..).max`, the new `pt2_expr::bounds_of_expr`) with validity
guards making the padding lanes no-ops. That is an expensive shape, and it is
the kind of thing an ordered-scatter primitive would collapse — the same
argument LUM-804 makes for select.

**The correctness nugget, so it is not lost in the bulk.**
`pt2_schema.rs`'s `Argument::as_float` learns to decode non-finite floats:

```rust
// PT2 JSON cannot encode IEEE non-finite values as JSON numbers,
// so torch serializes them as strings inside the usual as_float
// wrapper (notably linalg_vector_norm's +/-Infinity orders).
Argument::Other(value) => value.get("as_float").and_then(Value::as_str)
    .and_then(|value| match value {
        "Infinity" | "+Infinity" => Some(f64::INFINITY),
        "-Infinity" => Some(f64::NEG_INFINITY),
        "NaN" => Some(f64::NAN),
        _ => value.parse().ok(),
    }),
```

Before this, `linalg_vector_norm(x, ord=inf)` — the infinity norm, a perfectly
ordinary call — did not fail: `as_float` returned `None` and the argument
silently took whatever default the lowering had. **Any future PT2 boundary on
this branch inherits the same trap**: JSON has no encoding for `Infinity` or
`NaN`, so a serializer must use strings, and a reader that only accepts
`Value::Number` will silently mis-read them. That is a requirement on the M4
translator re-attachment, and it is not python-specific.

**Application and conflicts.** Applied as one 3-way patch (the "in one go"
path — no file was taken wholesale). Six hunks conflicted in five files,
every one because the park has drifted, and every resolution takes main's
content in the park's spelling:

| file | conflict | resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `translator/dispatch.rs` | the park still had `erf` inline in the match arm | main's `self.translate_erf(node)?` |
| `translator/mod.rs` | the park's `tensor_meta_to_shape` returns `Result<Vec<IntExpr>>` | main's seven new helpers inserted above it, `Expression` -> `IntExpr` |
| `translator/movement_dynamic.rs` | `row_major_strides` already widened to `pub(super)` at `&[IntExpr]` by #406 | main's new `ScatterReduction` enum ahead of it |
| `translator/tensor.rs` | `sort`'s dim/descending read (`a.shape.len()` here is `a.legacy_tracker_ref().len()`) | main's by-schema-name resolution, re-spelled |
| `translator/movement.rs` (x2) | the whole `reduce_scatter_elements` block landed on top of the park's `translate_scatter_value` | main's block, re-spelled |

**Residue** (diff-of-diffs against `2f820521`, per file). All five `.py`
files, `pt2_schema.rs` and `typed_data.rs` are EMPTY, and so are both new Rust
files apart from re-spellings. Everything else is exclusively the standing
park re-spellings — `Expression` -> `IntExpr`, and `X.shape` ->
`X.legacy_tracker_ref()` / `X.legacy_tracker_mut()` / `X.dims()` by whether the
tracker is read, mutated, or passed by value. **Drift-invariance check**: for
every carried file, `diff(main preimage, park before)` and `diff(main
postimage, park after)` differ ONLY by re-spellings of main's own added lines;
nothing pre-existing moved. In particular `movement_dynamic.rs` keeps the park
version of the `pt2_scatter_nd` trailing-offset scaffolding — the #402 row
recorded main's fix there as SUPERSEDED (this branch fixed the same defect by a
stronger mechanism in `src/frontend/movement.rs:563`), and this commit does not
quietly reintroduce main's version.

Two park costs stay as they are, and are noted so nobody "fixes" them by
accident: the crate's `.gather(` / `.scatter(` calls are still main's spelling
in 11 places (only the lines earlier batches happened to touch became
`gather1d` / `scatter1d`), and `ShapeTracker` — which the re-spelled
`legacy_tracker_ref()` / `legacy_tracker_mut()` return — no longer exists
anywhere in this branch's `src/`. The park does not build, and this commit does
not change that.

### FILE-LEVEL: 2 files into the `cuda_lite_hlir` park

`src/runtime.rs` and `src/tests/flashinfer.rs`, path-rewritten. Pure Rust
1.98 clippy churn: `bytes.chunks_exact(N).map(|c| T::from_ne_bytes([c[0],
...]))` becomes `bytes.as_chunks::<N>().0.iter().map(|b|
T::from_ne_bytes(*b))` in `get_i16` / `get_i32` / `get_i64` / `get_f64` and in
the bf16 test helper. Applied cleanly; residue empty.

**The same pattern exists in the live CL crate** at
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs:73`, `:79` and `:85` (three
`chunks_exact` readers). It is not touched here — nothing in this commit's
scope reaches the live crate, the workspace clippy gate is green as-is, and
converting them is a standalone cleanup, not part of this walk.

### LANDED-BY-EQUIVALENT — `src/frontend/movement.rs`

Main's one core hunk (+1/-1) adds `.simplify()` to pad's output dims:
`new_dims.push((dim + *start + *end).simplify())`. **This branch already does
exactly that**, at `src/frontend/movement.rs:1121`:

```rust
let out_dims: Vec<IntExpr> = dims.iter().zip(&padding)
    .map(|(d, (s, e))| (*d + *s + *e).simplify())
    .collect();
```

with the comment on the line above naming its provenance — *"Frontend
simplification restored (revert ruling 2026-08-27)"*. No edit; live core is
untouched by this commit.

### N/A — `examples/flux2/src/main.rs`

+4/-2, the same `chunks_exact` -> `as_chunks` churn in
`read_safetensors_f32`. This branch's `examples/flux2` has no `src/main.rs`:
it is `lib.rs` + `transformer.rs`, because model-zoo members here are
backend-neutral graph definitions and the executables live under the runtime
crate. Nothing to patch.

## #413 metal constants — banked, and the same defect is live in CUDA

RULED 2026-09-03: *"same 413 is fine. we can just merge this and check
later."* Two files, `crates/luminal_metal/src/{kernel/ops.rs, tests.rs}`,
applied cleanly at file level; residue EMPTY for both (drift-invariance check:
the park's 320- and 205-line drift sets are identical before and after). No
re-spelling was needed.

**The bug main fixed.** `MetalConstant` rendered its value as a decimal literal
with an `f` suffix, with a `fract() == 0.0` branch to force a decimal point.
`Display` is not total over `f32`: it renders the infinities as `inf` and NaNs
as `NaN`, so `-f32::INFINITY` became `-inff` and a NaN became `NaNf`, neither
of which is valid MSL. Shader compilation failed and the runtime PANICKED,
while `ReferenceRuntime` evaluated the same graph fine — a backend-only
divergence on perfectly ordinary values. The fix emits the bit pattern,
`as_type<float>(0x{bits:08x}u)`, an idiom already used for the RMSNorm epsilon
in that same file: exact for every `f32`, with no value-dependent branch. The
tests compare `MetalRuntime` against `ReferenceRuntime` over both infinities, a
NaN, both zeros, a subnormal and ordinary finite values using BIT equality,
because NaN compares false under `assert_close` and a NaN mismatch would
otherwise pass silently.

### CHECK (recorded, NOT acted on): the live CUDA constant has the same defect

The question asked was whether `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/ops/constant/`
renders non-finite `f32` safely — bit pattern or literal. **It renders a
literal, and it is not safe.** `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/ops/constant/mod.rs:96`:

```rust
let value = constant.value;                       // ConstantDps::value: f64, mod.rs:46
let source = format!(
    r#"extern "C" __global__ void k({to}* out, unsigned long long n) {{
    unsigned long long i = (unsigned long long)blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) out[i] = ({to}){value};
}}"#
);
```

`{value}` is `Display` on an `f64`, so `f32::INFINITY` emits
`out[i] = (float)inf;` and a NaN emits `out[i] = (float)NaN;`. Neither `inf`
nor `NaN` is a defined identifier in CUDA C++ (the spellings are `INFINITY` and
`NAN`, from `<cmath>`), so NVRTC fails to compile the kernel. It is the same
failure mode as Metal's, one layer down: the literal is not a valid token
rather than a valid token with the wrong value.

**It is reachable.** Nothing between the frontend and the kernel rejects a
non-finite constant: `Graph::constant_float` (`src/frontend/other.rs:37`)
records `LogicalOp::Constant(i as f64)` with no finiteness check, and the
matcher reads it straight back as `site.child_f64(0)`
(`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/ops/constant/mod.rs`, `ConstantMatcher::extract`).
Non-finite values are already ordinary traffic on this branch — the pad
NaN-safety tests landed under #406 build tensors containing `f32::INFINITY`,
`f32::NEG_INFINITY` and NaN (`src/frontend/movement.rs:1570`, `:1571`) — and
`pad_with` mints its fill through `constant_float`, so a `pad(.., f32::NEG_INFINITY)`
(the natural fill for a max-pool or a masked softmax) is exactly the call that
would produce an uncompilable kernel on CUDA while passing on the reference
runtime.

**Not acted on, per the ruling.** The fix is the same one-liner main used and
would be smaller here — CUDA has `__int_as_float(0x...)` as the direct analogue
of MSL's `as_type<float>` — but it needs a decision about which dtype the bits
belong to (`ConstantDps::value` is `f64` while the destination dtype comes from
`ctx.dest_dtypes[0]`, so the emitted literal has to be reinterpreted at the
DESTINATION width, not at f32 unconditionally), and it wants a
reference-vs-CUDA bit-equality test of the shape main added on the Metal side.
Recorded here as an open pin.

AMENDED 2026-09-04: fixed in PR #490 (fix/cuda-float-literal-emission).

## #416 vLLM regions — banked; the zero-extent slice question answered

RULED 2026-09-03: *"this is great and we should merge it. I don't think we
actually need to do anything, we should just be able to create zero extent
slices and nothing bad should happen? let's not special case slices producing
extent zero for now."*

### FILE-LEVEL: 11 files in `crates/luminal_python`

Applied cleanly, no conflicts and NO re-spelling: the drift-invariance check
shows every carried file's divergence from main is byte-identical before and
after, and the six new files (`src/luminal/{region_abi,region_compile,
region_export}.py` and their three pytest suites) came across verbatim.

The commit builds an **FX -> PT2 path**, so a host (vLLM) can hand luminal a
`torch.fx` region built from `FakeTensor` metadata and compile it
synchronously, instead of going through Dynamo's `.pt2` export. `region_abi.py`
defines the calling convention, `region_export.py` turns the FX region plus its
metadata into the schema the translator already reads, and
`region_compile.py` drives the compile. Two properties are worth naming:
compiled regions **preserve symbolic input relationships** (the same symbol
appearing in two inputs stays one symbol rather than becoming two independent
dims), and both **exact and bounded token lengths** are supported, which is
what vLLM's bucketing needs.

The Rust side is the bounds plumbing. `compiled_graph.rs` adds

```rust
/// Inclusive runtime bounds for symbolic dimensions.
pub type DimBoundsMap = HashMap<Symbol, (Option<usize>, Option<usize>)>;
```

alongside the existing `DimParamMap = HashMap<String, Symbol>`, carries it on
both graph structs, and `check_dim_bounds` refuses a runtime dimension outside
its declared range by name. **The key type applied verbatim**: main's
`DimBoundsMap` is keyed by `Symbol` and so is the park's `DimParamMap`
(`crates/luminal_python/rust/src/compiled_graph.rs:36`, identical text in both
trees since #396), so the crate stays self-consistent with no adaptation.

### FILE-LEVEL: 1 file into the `cuda_lite_hlir` park

`src/tests/consumed_buffer_tests.rs` (+50), path-rewritten. Main's new
`test_scatter_search_handles_shared_destination_branches` builds one scatter
whose result `shared` is read by FOUR sibling scatters, runs the search, and
asserts that at most ONE of the five selected scatter kernels is
`ScatterNoCopy` — i.e. *several results reading the same logical destination
forbids mutating it in place*.

**Is that invariant enforced by this branch's bufferizer? YES — it is the
conflict engine's central rule, and it is already pinned.** `src/bufferize.rs`
is an adaptation of MLIR One-Shot Bufferization, and its module header states
the rule at `:58`: every copy's overwrite is ordered after *"unordered readers
of its destination via **anti-dependency (WAR) edges**"*. The decision itself
is check (2), read-after-write interference, at `src/bufferize.rs:1194`:

> In-placing makes this op overwrite the operand's buffer. Any read of a value
> still aliasing that buffer — other than the result we are writing there —
> must provably happen before this op; otherwise it could observe the
> overwritten contents. Ordering is DAG reachability, so an *unordered* reader
> (no dependence path to this op) is a conflict, not a free pass.

Applied to main's graph: each of the four branch scatters proposing to
mutate `shared` in place finds the other three branches' reads of `shared` in
`self.reads`, none of them `happens_before` it, none of them the result being
written, none excused by the same-op `permits_sharing` permit (that permit is
scoped to same-op reads only, `src/bufferize.rs:1230`) — so `false`. Only the
producer of `shared`, which has a single ordered consumer, can be in place.
Note this branch is if anything STRICTER than main's assertion: main allows one
`ScatterNoCopy` among the branches, here none of the four qualifies.

It is a PIN, not just a property: `unordered_reader_of_operand_forces_out_of_place`
(`src/bufferize.rs:2664`) is exactly this case in miniature — *"the operand
value is read by a sibling op that is unordered with the writer. Reachability
cannot prove the read happens first, so the in-place write is refused (this is
the case a topological order would have wrongly allowed)"* — with
`reader_before_writer_allows_in_place` (`:2700`) as its converse and
`cross_operand_read_of_same_value_still_rejected` (`:2768`) closing the
per-USE hole. The WAR edges that carry the ordering into the plan are
installed by `crate::buffer_tensor_ir::install_anti_edges`
(`src/bufferize.rs:1776`) and are part of the plan's golden fingerprint
(`:473`). Nothing is owed here.

### DROPPED — the zero-extent slice special case

Main adds a short-circuit in `GraphTensor::slice`: if any output dim is
literally 0, overwrite the shape and return `self` without building the
gather, *"Building gather indices for it would create an Iota expression
containing modulo by zero"*. **Not ported, per the ruling.**

**And the reason it is safe not to port it is structural, not luck.** Main's
hazard comes from its slice lowering: it builds `flatten_strides(&new_dims,
&index_expressions)` and feeds the result to `graph().iota(index_expression,
new_dims)` — a FLAT index, which is where the div/mod chain (and the modulo by
zero) comes from. This branch does not lower a start-slice that way. Since the
views stage, a slice with any non-zero start records a **structure-preserving
`SliceView` node** whose parameters ARE the view: per parent axis `p`, a
`MapEntry::Coord { from_end, extent }` optionally wrapped in
`MapEntry::Add(.., Lit(start))` (`src/frontend/movement.rs:1024`-`1060`). There
is no `flatten_strides`, no flat iota, and no modulo — so an extent of 0
becomes a coordinate entry with extent 0 and nothing divides by anything. A
zero-start slice takes the other arm, `Movement::Shrink`, which only narrows
dims; also no arithmetic.

**Verified, all three ways in** (recording only, no search, no execution):
`input.slice_along(64.., 2)` on a `(1, 4, 64)` tensor records and reports dims
`[1, 4, 0]`; so do `slice_along(0..0, 2)` (the Shrink arm) and
`slice_along(3..3, 2)` (the view arm with a non-zero start and zero extent).
No panic, no refusal, no diagnostic. The answer to *"nothing bad should
happen?"* is: nothing does.

One test is kept, `zero_extent_slice_records_without_special_casing`
(`src/frontend/movement.rs`, beside the existing slice/pad tests), pinning the
first of those. It deliberately does NOT copy main's second assertion
(`empty.id == input.id`, "an empty slice must not create an Iota"): that
assertion encodes main's special case, and here the slice legitimately records
a view node with its own id. What is pinned is the OUTCOME — recording a
zero-extent slice yields a `[1, 4, 0]` tensor — not the absence of a node.

**What is still unproven, and is deliberately out of scope.** This pins the
RECORDER only. Whether a zero-extent tensor survives egglog saturation,
extraction, bufferization (a zero-byte buffer) and a backend kernel launch
(a zero-element grid) is untested here, and the ruling says *"for now"*. If a
zero extent ever does break something downstream, this test is where the
investigation starts, and the fix belongs at whichever stage actually breaks —
not as a frontend special case.

## #417 dtype contracts — the law recorded beside `dtype-of`; the machinery uncarried

RULED 2026-09-03: *"This is good, let's merge it."* Nothing in main's
`477d3626` is file-mergeable, so "merge it" lands its PRINCIPLE where this
branch keeps such laws, plus this row.

**Why nothing applies file-level.** Main's three files are `src/hlir.rs`
(+109/-30), `src/op.rs` (+18) and `src/graph.rs` (+198/-13). The first two were
DELETED with the HLIR layer when this branch replaced it; `src/graph.rs` still
exists but is a completely different file — main's is the HLIR graph plus its
compile search and loop-rolling prepass, this branch's is the SSA recorder.
There is no `HLIROp` trait to add a method to, no `Loop*` marker ops to stamp,
and no `auto_roll_loops_prepass` to thread dtypes through: `grep -ri
'auto_roll\|LoopStart\|LoopInput' src/ --include='*.rs'` returns nothing.
Repeated-region collapse is not a graph prepass here at all — it is the
extractor's problem, over the e-graph.

**What main actually fixed.** Loop rolling inserted six kinds of structural
marker (`LoopStart`, `LoopEnd`, `LoopInput`, `LoopInputStatic`, `LoopOutput`,
`LoopOutputSelect`) and stamped `dtype: DType::F32` into every one of them,
with a comment saying the field was "a placeholder, not a source of truth"
because a generic first-input propagation rule (`dtype_propagation_rule` /
`dtype_propagation_op`, ruleset `dtype_prop`) would derive the real dtype
inside the e-graph. It did not, reliably: main's own two regression tests show
a BF16 weight stream and an Int gather-index stream coming out of rolling as
F32 markers. #417 inverts the direction — every op declares its output dtype
(`HLIROp::output_dtype(&[DType]) -> DType`), `Graph::concrete_node_dtypes()`
resolves the whole graph in topological order from those declarations before
any marker is inserted, and the marker rewrites switch from
`dtype_propagation_*` to `dtype_from_field_rule` / `dtype_from_kind_field`, i.e.
the serialized field becomes the contract. The commit is, in one sentence,
*"stop inferring a dtype you were told."*

### CARRIED: the law, written beside `dtype-of`

`src/egglog_core/egglog_preamble.egg:422-447`, a comment block immediately
above the `dtype-of` declaration at `:448`. Comment only — no rule was added,
changed or deleted, because there is nothing to change: the branch already
obeys the law. It states that a value's dtype is DECLARED where the value is
minted (`LogicalNode.dtype`, `src/graph.rs:357`) and reaches the estate only as
the dtype field of `LogicalTensorInputLit` or the target of `LogicalCast`; that
every other dtype is concluded by a rule keyed on its OWN constructor; that the
estate must therefore never carry a generic first-input propagation; and it
cites #417 (`477d3626`) as the written justification, naming the failure main
hit.

### Verification (both claims checked, 2026-09-03)

**1. `dtype-of` is `:no-merge` — YES.**
`src/egglog_core/egglog_preamble.egg:448`:

```
(function dtype-of (LogicalTensor) Dtype :no-merge)
```

It sits in the block whose header (`:416-417`) says *"The purpose of these
functions it to cause runtime errors in the face of bad unions… enforcing
invariants at runtime"*, beside `rank-of`, `shape-of`, `bits-of`,
`buffer-access-of` and `buffer-freed-by`. `:no-merge` is STRONGER than main's
situation, not weaker: main's marker field declaration was `:merge new`
(last-write-wins), which is exactly why the commit message notes a
wrongly-stamped marker could "corrupt its source class's dtype fact through the
inline union". Here a second, disagreeing `dtype-of` for one class is a
saturation panic. A guessed dtype unioned over a declared one cannot be a
silent mistype on this branch; it would abort the run.

**2. Is there a generic first-input `dtype-of` propagation rule? NO.**
Every `(set (dtype-of …))` in the tree was enumerated — 29 sites in 22 files
(`grep -rn --include='*.egg' 'set (dtype-of' .`, vendor excluded):

- **1 in the preamble** (`egglog_preamble.egg:910`), and it is keyed on the
  DECLARED FIELD, not on an input: the rule matches
  `(LogicalTensorInputLit ?var ?shape ?dtype)` and sets `dtype-of` to `?dtype`.
  That is structurally main's fix (`dtype_from_field_rule`), already in place.
- **28 across the 21 per-op `src/logical_op/*/dtype.egg` files**, each keyed on
  ITS OWN constructor. This is main's `output_dtype` table, spelled as rules:
  `iota/dtype.egg:8` sets `(Int)` unconditionally; `less_than/dtype.egg:9` sets
  `(Bool)` unconditionally; `cast/dtype.egg:7` sets the target dtype carried in
  the term; `gather/dtype.egg:8` takes the DATA operand's (not operand 0's,
  which is the coordinate list) — the same four overrides main had to write by
  hand.
- The remaining per-op rules do read an input's dtype (`sin`, `sqrt`, `exp`,
  `exp2`, `log2`, `recip`, `index_map_apply`, `reduce_sum`, `reduce_max` take
  the single input's; `add`, `mul`, `div`, `modulo`, `trunc_div`, `trunc_rem`,
  `scatter` set from BOTH operands duplicatively, deliberately, as a `:no-merge`
  tripwire on a mismatch). None of them is the dangerous shape: each matches one
  named constructor, so "preserve the input's dtype" is that op's own declared
  contract, never an opcode-blind fallback applied to a marker.

**One vestige, reported and NOT touched.** The ruleset main's generic rules
lived in still exists: `p.add_ruleset("dtype_prop")` at
`src/egglog_core/egglog_utils/base.rs:541`. On this branch it is EMPTY — the
only other live mention in the whole tree is the parked
`crates/luminal_metal/src/kernel/ops.rs:3509` (`:ruleset dtype_prop`), which
does not build. Note also that `base.rs`'s `DType` is the BACKEND/LLIR sort
built by `base_expression_egglog_impl`, a different thing from the logical
`Dtype` that `dtype-of` ranges over. Left in place; recorded here so a future
reader does not mistake an empty ruleset for a live propagation.

### UNCARRIED

- **`HLIROp::output_dtype`** (`src/op.rs`, the trait default = "first input's
  dtype", plus the `Box<T>` forward) and its per-op overrides in `src/hlir.rs`:
  `Input` -> its declared field, `CustomOpKind` -> its declared field,
  `Constant` -> `F32`, `ConstantF64` -> `F64`, `Iota` -> `Int`, `Cast` -> the
  target, `LessThan` -> `Bool` (asserting both operands agree), `Gather` ->
  input 1, `Scatter` -> input 2, and the six markers via `marker_output_dtype`.
  There is no `HLIROp` trait here; the table itself exists as the per-op
  `dtype.egg` rules above.
- **`Graph::concrete_node_dtypes()`** — the topological resolve with "no
  fallback dtype", including its cross-check against `input_meta`'s recorded
  dtype. The branch's analogue is not a pass: dtype is carried on every
  `LogicalNode` from the moment it is recorded, so there is nothing to resolve
  after the fact.
- **`Graph::uniform_node_dtype()`** and the rolling-site assertions (a loop slot
  may not change dtype between its initial value, its body state output and its
  final state output; every per-iteration source of one input stream must agree;
  every per-iteration producer of one output stream must agree). These are
  properties OF loop rolling, which does not exist here.
- **`marker_output_dtype()`** — the assertion that a marker's declared field
  equals every one of its tensor sources. No marker ops.
- **The rewrite swap** on the six markers, `dtype_propagation_rule` /
  `dtype_propagation_op` -> `dtype_from_field_rule` / `dtype_from_kind_field`.
  Nothing to swap: there is no generic propagation to remove (verified above).
- **The two regression tests**, `loop_rolling_stamps_concrete_varying_stream_dtypes`
  (BF16 weight stream survives rolling) and
  `loop_rolling_preserves_integer_gather_stream_dtypes` (Int index stream and
  the F32 carried activation both survive). Untranslatable — they assert on
  `LoopInput`/`LoopStart` fields after `auto_roll_loops_prepass_with_log`.

**Nothing is owed.** Unlike most INTENT-ONLY rows in this ledger, this one does
not name a future requirement: main's end state is this branch's starting
state. What is owed is only that it stay that way, which is what the comment is
for.

## #418 vLLM serving — parks banked; embeddability requirements recorded (parity owed)

RULED 2026-09-03: *"we'll record only, we'll eventually have to get to
parity."* Main's `6681720b` (+1249/-171, 18 files) is the commit that makes
luminal EMBEDDABLE: a host process (vLLM) selects the device, hands luminal its
own CUDA stream, supplies the output allocations, captures luminal's kernels
into the host's own CUDA graph, and reuses one compiled artifact across
rebindings. Seventeen of the eighteen files are park files and went across
untouched. The eighteenth is core and does not exist here.

### FILE-LEVEL: 17 files, residue EMPTY on every one

Twelve `crates/luminal_python/**` (`rust/src/{compiled_graph,
pt2_compiled_model}.rs`, `src/luminal/{__init__,artifact_cache,compiled_model,
main,pt2,region_compile,region_export}.py`, `tests/{test_capsule_validation,
test_region_compile,test_region_export}.py` — `artifact_cache.py` is new,
+130), four into the `cuda_lite_hlir` park (`Cargo.toml`, `src/runtime.rs`,
`src/dyn_backend.rs`, `src/kernel/to_host.rs`, path-rewritten from
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/`), and one metal-park file
(`crates/luminal_metal/src/dyn_backend.rs`, +1/-1, the `execute` signature).

**Every one applied cleanly — no conflicts, and NO re-spelling was needed.**
The diff-of-diffs check (main's per-file hunk set, path-rewritten, versus the
hunk set actually banked, normalized for line offsets) is byte-IDENTICAL for
all 17. The park conventions were re-checked afterwards and hold:
`named_tensor_dtyped` is still 0 occurrences in `crates/luminal_python`; no
added line reintroduces `Expression` or a Rust `.shape` field access (the two
`.shape` hits in the added Python are `torch.Tensor.shape`); and the park's own
drift survives untouched (`early_stop_exceeded` still at
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/runtime.rs:55`, `IntExpr` still spelled in
`runtime.rs` and `kernel/to_host.rs`). None of the three crates is a workspace
member, so nothing was built.

What the park now carries, in main's terms: `CudaRuntime` gains an
`owned_stream` beside its execution `cuda_stream` plus
`use_borrowed_stream(raw: u64)` / `use_owned_stream()` /
`select_execution_stream()`, and a `synchronize_stream` flag that makes the
terminal `self.cuda_stream.synchronize()` — and the batched writeback sync in
`copy_outputs_to_device_ptrs` — CONDITIONAL: owned-stream execution stays
blocking, borrowed-stream execution leaves completion ordered on the caller's
stream. `external_cuda_graph` makes `execute` detect an ACTIVE capture on the
caller's stream and, in that case, skip luminal's own graph materialization and
launch the individual steps (`CudaGraphOp::launch_steps`, the `enqueue_prepared`
/ `validate_pointers` / `requires_output_buffer` split in
`kernel/to_host.rs`) so the host's capture picks them up. Arena allocation
learns to EXCLUDE caller-registered output nodes
(`external_output_nodes` threaded into `allocate_intermediate_buffers`), so a
reallocation cannot silently overwrite a pointer the host owns. `Cargo.toml`
re-points `cudarc` at the `luminal-ai` fork.
On the Python side `CompiledModel` gains `use_current_stream`,
`static_outputs` (fixed max-capacity CUDA output buffers reused across calls,
returned as views at the current runtime shapes), `device_index` enforcement
via `_cuda_device_index`, and an `artifact` handle whose `activate(binding)`
returns True when the shared compiled artifact was last used by a DIFFERENT
binding — the signal to re-register every input device pointer.
`artifact_cache.py` keys structurally identical FX regions (symbol names
normalized) so separate positional bindings share one search.

### UNCARRIED: `src/dyn_backend.rs` (+18/-5)

The file was deleted on this branch; there is no `DynBackend` trait, no
`BackendCompileArgs`, and no PyCapsule seam (`grep -rn 'pyo3\|PyCapsule\|
BackendFactory' src/` returns nothing — the python crate is parked, not
attached to the recorder). Main's five changes there, recorded for the
re-attachment:

- `fn device_index(&self) -> Option<usize>` on the trait, defaulting to `None`.
- `fn execute(&mut self, dyn_map: &DynMap, stream: Option<u64>)` — the raw
  borrowed stream is threaded through the trait itself, and
  `ReferenceDynBackend::execute` asserts `stream.is_none()`.
- `BackendCompileArgs` gains `device_index: Option<usize>` and
  `external_cuda_graph: bool`.
- `BACKEND_FACTORY_CAPSULE_NAME` bumped `"luminal.backend_factory"` ->
  `"luminal.backend_factory.v2"`, with the reason stated in the doc comment:
  *"The version is part of the ABI: `BackendCompileArgs` crosses this boundary
  by value, so an older plugin must be rejected rather than reading a changed
  struct layout."* Note this REPLACES the previous comment, which promised the
  name would never change for compatibility with older producers — main
  deliberately reversed that promise, and the versioned form is the one worth
  copying.

### THE FIVE EMBEDDABILITY REQUIREMENTS (recorded, nothing acted on)

Each is stated as a requirement on the live CL executor — `execute_plan` in
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs`, called from
`CudaRuntime::execute` (`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/runtime.rs:299-307`) —
with today's state verified in the tree, not assumed.

**STATE AS OF `acde9ac1` (2026-09-03, BEFORE Phase 3 of the #420/#422
rejoin).** Phases 3 and 4 below changed the executor's shape, so read every
*Today* item and every `device.rs:NNN` cite in this section as pre-Phase-3:
`CudaDevice` now persists the context, the one stream, the NVRTC module cache
and the arena slab across calls, created once and owned by `CudaRuntime`;
INTERIOR buffers are sub-ranges of that slab rather than fresh allocations; and
payloads are `HostBuffer`, not `TypedBuffer`. Still true as written: device 0
is hardcoded, standalone and escaping (output-backing) allocations are fresh
per call, outputs are D2H'd into fresh host vectors, and the terminal
synchronize is unconditional. EVERY REQUIREMENT BELOW STILL STANDS.

**(1) Explicit CUDA device selection.** *Today: device 0 is hardcoded, and the
context is created per call.* `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs:156`:

```rust
let ctx = CudaContext::new(0).context("no CUDA device 0")?;
```

`execute_plan` takes only `(plan, staged)`; `CudaRuntime::execute(&mut self)`
(`runtime.rs:299`) takes nothing at all, and `CudaRuntime` holds no context or
device field. Main's shape is the parameterized one: the device index arrives
in `BackendCompileArgs`, the factory refuses a missing index outright
(*"CUDA backend requires a device index"*), the runtime reports it back through
`device_index()`, and the Python side cross-checks that every input tensor
lives on that logical device (`main.py::_cuda_device_index`). Requirement: the
device is an argument of the call, reported back to the host, and a mismatch
between the host's tensors and the executor's device is a loud refusal. (Main
still restricts to logical device 0 — the multi-device work is the plumbing,
not the capability.)

**(2) Execution on a caller-owned stream the executor neither destroys nor
synchronizes.** *Today: the context's default stream, created per call, with an
unconditional terminal synchronize.* `device.rs:157`
(`let stream = ctx.default_stream();`) and `device.rs:456`
(`stream.synchronize().context("stream sync")?;`), followed by blocking
`memcpy_dtoh` per output slot (`device.rs:472`). There is no way to pass a
stream in and no flag that suppresses the sync. Requirement, in two halves:
(a) an entry point that takes a raw `CUstream` from the host, wraps it BORROWED
(main: `context.wrap_borrowed_stream`, behind an `unsafe fn` whose contract is
that the owner keeps it alive), and re-points every launch at it — the executor
must never destroy it; and (b) an explicit SYNCHRONIZE-OR-NOT policy tied to
that choice: owned stream => blocking, as today; borrowed stream => return with
the work merely enqueued, completion ordered on the caller's stream, and the
D2H readback path must then be optional too, because a host that supplied its
own output buffers does not want the copy at all. Main spells the policy as one
bool, `synchronize_stream`, set by whichever of `use_owned_stream` /
`use_borrowed_stream` was called.

**(3) Fixed-capacity, stable-address, caller-owned output buffers the planner
must not reuse.** *Today: the executor allocates every buffer itself, fresh,
per call, and hands back host copies.* Phase 1 allocates one `alloc_zeros` per
plan buffer including the ones backing output slots (`device.rs:198`); Phase 4
copies each output slot's backing buffer D2H into a fresh `Vec<u8>` and returns
owned `TypedBuffer`s keyed by slot index (`device.rs:466-476`), which
`CudaRuntime` stores in `outputs_host` (`runtime.rs:51`, `:307`). So output
storage is neither caller-owned nor stable across calls, and its address is not
even stable across two executions of the same plan. The requirement has three
parts a host needs simultaneously: the host supplies the output pointer; that
pointer is FIXED-CAPACITY (allocated once at the maximum shape and re-viewed at
the current runtime shape, which is main's `static_outputs` — CUDA-graph
capture demands a stable address, so a per-shape allocation is not an option);
and the planner/allocator must be forbidden from handing that buffer's range to
anything else (main's fix is literally a filter — `external_output_nodes`
excluded from `logical_buffer_offsets` before arena assignment).
**The seam already exists and already says so.** `device.rs:215-222` at
`acde9ac1` (re-scoped by Phase 3 — see **CONTRACT-1: re-scoped, not dropped,
not duplicated**), the CONTRACT-1 bind-time check, was written for exactly this
future:

> distinct BufferIds must be backed by disjoint device ranges … Fresh
> `alloc_zeros` per buffer makes this hold by construction today; the assert is
> the contract's enforcement face for when raw caller pointers arrive at this
> binding surface. Loud refusal, never mistranslation.

The "fresh `alloc_zeros`" clause is gone since Phase 3: the executor's assert
now covers only the standalone and donated rows it allocates itself, and the
slab's half is decided at planning time in `arena.rs`. That is still where a
caller pointer table would be bound, and the disjointness assert is what would
catch a host handing in two overlapping ranges.
#422's zero-copy fix implies: a registration carries `(ptr, capacity)`; a grown
dynamic output must be re-registered before the plan is bound, never patched in
the executor — RECORDED ONLY, no runtime checks by ruling (2026-09-03).

**(4) Functionalized mutation writebacks.** *Today: absent from the executor,
though the PLAN ontology already has the vocabulary.* A serving host's KV
cache is a caller tensor that the graph logically returns a new value for and
the host wants written back in place; main batches every such copy into one
`copy_outputs_to_device_ptrs` submission and (post-#418) syncs it only in
owned-stream mode, with `CompiledModel` refusing a writeback target that is not
a contiguous CUDA tensor of the right dtype and element count, and refusing
outright if the target's allocation CHANGED between calls. Here, `grep -rni
'writeback\|donat' crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/*.rs` finds exactly one hit,
and it is a comment: the escape guard at `device.rs:126-132`, which reasons
about DONATED boundary storage while refusing a plan whose output is backed by
`FreedBy::Program`. The plan level is genuinely ready — `Owner::{Caller,
System}` (`src/bufferize.rs:115-120`), `Access::{ReadOnly, ReadWrite}` and
`FreedBy::{Caller, Program}` (`src/layout_ir/mod.rs:704-721`, deliberately
orthogonal: *"permission to clobber bytes never implies responsibility to
destroy storage"*) are exactly the facts a writeback needs. What is missing is
only the executor seam: a way to name the caller's destination pointer for an
output slot, and a batched, once-synchronized (or not-synchronized) copy to it.

**(5) A versioned FFI seam.** *Today: none, and none is owed yet — but the
version discipline is.* There is no python attachment on this branch at all
(see UNCARRIED above), so nothing crosses a C boundary from live core. When one
is built, main's rule is the one to adopt: the capsule name CARRIES the ABI
version (`luminal.backend_factory.v2`) precisely because the argument struct
crosses by value, so bumping the name is how an older producer gets a clean
rejection instead of a reinterpreted struct — and #418 is itself the proof, a
commit that added two fields to `BackendCompileArgs` and one parameter to
`DynBackend::execute` in the same breath. Note the python park's
`test_capsule_validation.py` already pins name-mismatch rejection, so the test
shape is banked even though the seam is not.

**Nothing here is a defect.** The CL executor is a correct standalone executor;
every gap above is a capability it was never asked for. This section exists so
that when it IS asked for, the list is already written and already measured
against the code.

## Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 1 (runtime-owned search)

**The move.** Post-saturation search left core. Core now keeps only what
every runtime shares — the logical program and its recorder, the egglog
assembly, `dps_rewrite`, `layouts::decode_layout_table`, `bufferize`, the
IR types, the visualizers — and nothing that decides which
implementation wins.

| Was | Is now | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/extractor.rs` (4288 lines) | `luminal_reference::extractor`, `luminal_cuda_lite::extractor`, `test_runtime::extractor` | Three verbatim copies, minus `decoded_layout_table`. Tests (`render_memo_tests`, plus `chain_strides_destructure_contract` moved in from core `test_support`) live with the REFERENCE copy only. **AMENDED 2026-09-04, Phase 8: the three copies are one again, `luminal::extraction`; these names are aliases for it.** |
| `src/implementation_search.rs` (1849 lines) | `luminal_reference::search`, `luminal_cuda_lite::search`; the sampler half also as `test_runtime::sampler` | The GA loop, the SCC sampler, both tripwires, `SearchProgress`, `BucketPlan`/`select_bucket`. Tests (`progress_tests`, `early_stop_tests`, `sampler_tests`, the dedup search test) live with the REFERENCE copy only. **AMENDED 2026-09-04, Phase 8: the sampler, the tripwires, `SearchProgress`, `RefusalBreakdown`, `SearchTimings` and `early_stop_exceeded` are `luminal::search_support`, one copy; the LOOPS, the options, the outcomes and the bucketed drivers stay here.** |
| `extractor::decoded_layout_table` + `layout_ir::LayoutDecoder<L>` | `layouts::decode_layout_table` + `layouts::DecodedLayout` (core) | D9. The per-runtime decoder hook is deleted; both runtimes instantiate `BufferIrGraph` with core's struct. `RefLayout`/`ReferenceLayoutDecoder`/`CudaLayout`/`CudaLayoutDecoder` are gone. |
| `buffer_tensor_ir::TypedBuffer` + `ReferenceKernelCtx` (552 lines) | `luminal_reference::typed_buffer` | D4. Out of core's prelude too. |
| — | `luminal_cuda_lite::host_buffer::HostBuffer` | D4. Bytes + a dtype tag; the device bridge became a memcpy. |
| `implementation_search::{PlanProfiler, StaticProfiler}` | DELETED | Each loop evaluates INLINE: the reference runs the candidate, CL calls `luminal_cuda_lite::heuristic::heuristic_cost_of`. |
| `ImplementationSearchOptions` | `CompileOptions` (per runtime) | D5, main's name. Same fields, defaults, builder. |
| `test_support::harness_search_options` | `luminal_reference::harness_search_options`, `luminal_cuda_lite::harness_search_options` | A production-path helper (the CL examples call it) that names a runtime's option type. |
| `implementation_search::bucketed_search_implementations` | each runtime's `search.rs`, re-expressed over `BucketAssembly` | D7. Driven from the ladder: `bind_dim_buckets` / `set_dim` / `bucket_plans`. |

**The rulings this implements** (Austin, 2026-09-03). Simple duplication
per runtime rather than a generic seam; `SearchSpace` wherever it lands;
`bufferize` stays in core because multiple backends use it; the thing
that ranked CL candidates is a HEURISTIC and is named one; saturation is
runtime-triggered; the reference keeps its profiling GA and CL keeps a
genetic search over a device-free prior; runtimes call `bufferize`
themselves; `TypedBuffer` is the reference runtime's; buckets now; the
core decoder produces the layout struct the runtimes import directly;
CL search lives in the runtime and runtimes choose how to handle
failures.

**Decisions inside the latitude.**

- *`test_runtime` gets a THIRD copy* rather than borrowing CUDA-lite's
  (which it already depends on for the cuBLASLt marker estate). Its
  Cargo charter is explicit that anything it wants from another runtime
  is replicated, never borrowed, and the marker estate is the single
  named exception. Consequence: the election core's `Genome` is now a
  different type from `test_runtime`'s, so the wrappers re-key it
  structurally (`adopt_genome` / `adopt_choice` — `ClassId` and `NodeId`
  come from the shared `egraph-serialize`, so the mapping is total and
  unambiguous). **AMENDED 2026-09-04, Phase 8: the charter is about
  RUNTIMES and core is not one, so `test_runtime` takes core's copy like
  everyone else; `adopt_genome` / `adopt_choice` and the bridge closure
  are DELETED — there is one `Genome`.**
- *`HostBuffer` has no `From<Vec<u8>>`.* Bool8 goes through the
  validated `HostBuffer::bool8` constructor: a `From` is by definition
  an unchecked door, and Bool8 has exactly two legal codes. `Vec<f64>`
  likewise has none, for the reason `TypedBuffer` has none — an
  unsuffixed float literal would silently pick it.
- *`CudaRuntime::get_f32` returns `Vec<f32>`,* not `&Vec<f32>`: bytes
  cannot lend a typed vector. `get_i32` / `get_i64` / `get_bool8` join
  it.
- *The reference bucketed entry is `search_buckets`,* taking the input
  data as a FUNCTION of the pins. Buckets searched at different
  representatives want differently sized payloads, so one fixed map
  cannot stage them all; `search` refuses when buckets are bound instead
  of mis-fitting them. CUDA-lite's `search` serves both shapes because
  its ranking reads no data at all.
- *One test was DELETED rather than moved:*
  `search_passes_the_incumbent_metric_to_every_later_profile_call`. It
  drove a hand-written `PlanProfiler` to observe the `best_so_far`
  cutoff crossing the trait boundary — and that boundary no longer
  exists. The PREDICATE's semantics stay pinned by
  `early_stop_exceeded`'s own board
  (`luminal_reference::search::early_stop_tests`, and since Phase 4 a
  copy in `luminal_cuda_lite::search` too). AMENDED 2026-09-03 (review
  finding C6): the loop's PLUMBING that the deleted test also pinned —
  `None` for the baseline candidate, the incumbent's mean for every
  later one, one evaluation per profiled plan (the `best_so_far`
  binding handed to `profile_on_reference_runtime`) — is currently
  UNPINNED. With the profiler seam gone there is no hook to observe it
  short of adding one, and the stop is exact, so no selection outcome
  can witness it. Recorded, not solved.
- *The per-candidate input clone stays.* Each candidate gets a fresh
  `ReferenceRuntime` and `set_data_buffer` takes ownership. Removing it
  is a runtime-surface change (a borrowing stage API), not a Phase 1
  one.
- *One latent bug fixed by the move.* The extractor's op-cache lookup
  was `if let Some(..) = cache.borrow().get(..) { .. } else {
  ..borrow_mut().. }`, which is correct under edition 2024 (where the
  `if let` temporary dies before the `else`) and panics under edition
  2021 — which is where all three copies live. Split into a statement +
  `match`. AMENDED 2026-09-04: the three copies live in 2024 crates
  now — see **Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 7 (edition 2024 for
  the runtime crates)** below. The split STAYS: it is correct in both
  editions, and copies should not depend on their host's edition.

**The limitation Phase 1 states rather than solves.** Every bucket's
winning plan is STATIC at its representative: plan spans are literals,
so a plan searched at `a = 3` allocates and indexes for `a = 3`. Both
ladders REFUSE loudly when asked to execute a bucket's plan at another
value inside that bucket, naming the representative and pointing at the
open item — symbolic plans (spans as expressions) and the capacity
contract that goes with them. Pinned on both sides.

**Still owed** (as written at Phase 1; AMENDED at Phase 5, 2026-09-03).
Device profiling for CUDA-lite (the heuristic is a weak prior — bytes
moved is uncorrelated with occupancy, launch count, coalescing, library
dispatch) — DELIVERED in Phase 4: `CompileOptions::profile_on_device`,
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/profile.rs`, see **Program: #420/#422
rejoin — Phase 4 (device evaluator)** below. The arena allocator behind
the runtimes' `bufferize` call — DELIVERED for CUDA-lite in Phase 3:
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/arena.rs`, see **Phase 3 (the arena and
the persistent device)** below; the reference runtime has none, by
ruling. Still open: the spec re-authoring against this shape (see
**#404 spec.md**), and whatever consolidation the three copies
eventually earn — a question to ask after the runtimes diverge, not
before. **ANSWERED 2026-09-04: they did not diverge. Seven phases on the
three walks differed by one API-shape hunk and zero logic lines, the
census put 86% of 9,567 duplicated lines in the extractor with zero
runtime residue, and the walk, the sampler and the reporting came back
to core — see Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 8 below. The loops
stayed.**

## Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 2 (configurable registry)

**The ruling** (Austin, 2026-09-03): *"you should select the allowed ops
when you initialize the runtime. we should have a function for filtering
which ops, which matchers are present, etc. You should not need to edit
CL in order to modify this. It should be configurable."*

**What changed.** `CudaRuntime`'s private `cublaslt: bool` is gone. An
instance now HOLDS its op vocabulary: the matcher column of the registry
it was loaded with, plus the allow list derived from that same registry,
both fixed once in `load_with_registry(graph, Vec<RegisteredOp>)`.
`load` is that call over `cuda_registry()`; `load_with_cublaslt` is it
over `cuda_registry_with_cublaslt()` — the marker preset is a registry
VALUE now, not a mode, and its default-off status stays a budget
decision that costs a caller one argument to overrule. Assembly,
saturation, extraction and search all read the instance's list;
`active_allow_list()` is what a loaded runtime claims. The static
`CudaRuntime::allow_list()` / `allow_list_with_cublaslt()` /
`cuda_allow_list()` survive unchanged as the PRESETS' claim sets, for
callers with no graph in hand.

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-09-04 (cuBLASLt on by default).** The default-off
> budget decision above is reversed: `cuda_registry()` is now the FULL
> registry, markers included, and `load` is that call. The names
> `cuda_registry_with_cublaslt`, `load_with_cublaslt` and
> `allow_list_with_cublaslt` are deleted; the decomposed route is asked
> for by name through the new `cuda_registry_without_cublaslt()`. The
> paragraph above stands as the record of the Phase-2 state.

**The configuration surface** (all outside-callable, no CL edit):
`cuda_registry_filtered(|op| ...)` narrows the FULL registry (marker rows
included, so a predicate can opt a row in as easily as out);
`RegisteredOp::new(matcher, prototype)` builds a row from outside;
`RegisteredOp::constructor()` / `RegisteredOp::label()` are what a
predicate reads. `label()` is the house label — the egglog constructor
minus the `LayoutTensorOp` prefix and nothing else, so it keeps its
`Generic` suffix and equals the prototype's own `LayoutIrOp::label`
(pinned).

**Decisions inside the latitude.**

- *The matcher list is LENT, not rebuilt.* `dyn OpMatcher` is not
  clonable and the registry is a value the caller hands over once, so
  there is nothing to rebuild it from; the runtime holds
  `Vec<Box<dyn OpMatcher>>` and `search_implementations` /
  `bucketed_search_implementations` / the extractor's
  `new_with_matcher_set` take `&[Box<dyn OpMatcher>]`. The extractor's
  dispatch map became `HashMap<&'static str, &'a dyn OpMatcher>` — the
  `'a` it already carried for the e-graph. The bucketed entry's
  `impl Fn() -> Vec<..>` factory parameter collapsed into that slice.
  The alternative, a `boxed_clone` supertrait on core's `OpMatcher`,
  would have forced `#[derive(Clone)]` onto every matcher in three
  crates for nothing. NO CORE EDIT was needed.
- *The instance accessor is `active_allow_list`,* not `allow_list`:
  inherent methods may not share a name, and the static one is the
  documented preset seam with existing callers. It returns
  `&[&'static str]` — the instance owns the vector, and nothing needs a
  copy.
- *Kernel-bearing rows stay CL-only.* An outside `RegisteredOp` reaches
  the allow list through the two DERIVED matcher-only classes
  (plan-transparent, host-dispatchable); a row that must actually be
  executed needs a codegen entry in `kernels`, keyed by `TypeId` inside
  this crate. AMENDED 2026-09-03 (review finding C12): the kernel-bearing
  test is by LABEL, codegen by `TypeId`. A row whose label is not in the
  kernel table is never claimed (refusal at search); a row that REUSES a
  kernel-table label with a different op type IS claimed and refuses at
  `execute` (`no cuda codegen for <label>`) — never a wrong plan, but
  not at search.
- *One estate that is NOT row-by-row* (added 2026-09-03, review finding
  C11): the four cuBLASLt marker rows share one egglog vocabulary,
  declared and minted by the Base row's snippets. A registry holding a
  non-Base marker row without Base would derive a claim for an op the
  assembled program never declares — `load_with_registry` refuses that
  configuration by name (`registry_selection.rs`
  `a_non_base_cublaslt_row_without_base_is_refused_at_load`).

**The punt, recorded.** Composing an external kernel superset onto
Lite's codegen ("cuda heavy") is NOT started: no execution face on
`RegisteredOp`, no change to the kernel table's `TypeId` keying, no
change to cuBLASLt's dispatch arm. Value-level registry rows are the
whole extension axis for now, which is the same call the Phase 1 park
made about `CudaRuntimeImpl<O: IntoEgglogOp>`.

**Pinned** (`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/tests/registry_selection.rs`, host
only): the two presets equal their `load_with_registry` spellings and
the marker preset is the default plus exactly the four host-call
contracts; a registry filtered of the add row makes `a + b` REFUSE at
search with the exhaustion message diagnosing a dead end (choice-cycles
0), while the same graph under the default registry plans; a marker row
pushed on from the test crate through `RegisteredOp::new` joins the
instance claim set and the other three forms stay out; every row's
`label()` agrees with its prototype's.

## #420 search into the runtime — parks banked, the boundary move scheduled

RULED 2026-09-03: *"we're going to ignore all the loop unrolling, loop rolling
stuff, but we're going to follow all the other aspects and move all of that
functionality out of core and into the runtimes."* Main's `f285d229`
(+5432/-4812, 19 files) deletes 4946 lines from `src/graph.rs` and moves the
whole post-saturation search — extraction, mutation, profiling, hard
filtering, bucket-set validation and loading — out of core into each runtime.
Core is left with a NAMED ARTIFACT (`SearchSpace`) and a TOOLKIT
(`luminal::search`) that core itself never invokes; the module doc says it
plainly (`src/search/mod.rs:1-20`): *"Core stops at a `SearchSpace` ...
Choosing a program from it is the runtime's job ... core never invokes any of
it."*

This is the commit this branch has been converging on from the other side, so
the code re-expression is a multi-phase program of its own, planned at
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/6b5d25e3-94cf-4089-8977-8e44f971b8a5 (phases,
gates, per-phase A100 checkpoints, and the twenty decisions it turns on). THIS
row records and parks only.

### FILE-LEVEL: 4 park files

Three `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/` files path-rewritten into
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/`: `lib.rs` (+1), `runtime.rs` (+70/-203), and
the NEW `search.rs` (+173) — the runtime-side driver loop that is the whole
point of the commit; plus one metal-park file,
`crates/luminal_metal/src/runtime.rs` (+82/-44), where `Runtime::profile`
becomes an inherent method.

Two conflicts, both park drift, both resolved to main's content:
`compile_and_validate_profile_candidate`'s two reject arms (the park had lost
main's `luminal::mask_events::RESOURCE_REJECT.record_with` line) and the metal
`profile` block (the park copy carried #386's `early_stop` parameter). The
metal park keeps its local `early_stop_exceeded` stub spelling, since
`luminal::op` does not exist here. Diff-of-diffs residue is those two items
and nothing else. Neither crate is a workspace member; nothing builds.

### INTENT: the 15 files NOT applied, and what replaces them

`src/search/{mod,genetic,finalist,lattice,diagnostics,packed,unroll,tests}.rs`,
`src/graph.rs`, `src/op.rs`, `src/hlir.rs`, `src/egglog_utils/mod.rs`,
`src/lib.rs`, `spec.md`, `AGENTS.md`. None is applicable as a patch: this
branch deleted `src/hlir.rs` and `src/op.rs` with the HLIR layer, `src/graph.rs`
is a different file (the recorder), there is no LLIR and no `Runtime` trait —
only `RuntimeBindingsGenerator` (`src/runtime_binding.rs:19`) — and search
lives in `src/implementation_search.rs` over the e-graph. The requirements the
later phases must satisfy, each checked against today's tree:

**(1) A `SearchSpace` named at saturation.** Main's
`Graph::build_search_space` (`f285d229:src/graph.rs:1585-1628`) saturates ONCE
per dynamic-dim bucket combination and hands back
`SearchSpace { buckets, ops, custom_ops, dim_buckets }`. Here there is no such
artifact and no single owner of saturation: it happens inside
`ReferenceRuntime::search` (`crates/luminal_reference/src/runtime.rs:213-284`)
and inside `CudaRuntime::assemble_and_saturate`
(`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/runtime.rs:186-239`) as near-duplicate blocks,
plus once more in core's unmounted, test-only
`bucketed_search_implementations` (`src/implementation_search.rs:1099-1213`).
The requirement is one core function that assembles and saturates, called by
the runtime, returning a named artifact — the runtime keeps deciding WHEN.

**(2) Runtime-owned search, profiling and loading.** Main deletes thirteen
`Runtime` hooks (`profile`, `profile_with_bucket_context`,
`prepare_profile_candidate`, `profile_prepared_candidate`,
`filter_llir_candidate`, `filter_llir_bucket_set`, `aggregate_profile_metrics`,
`allocate_dummy_input`, `has_hlir_buffer`, `clear_intermediate_buffers`,
`intermediate_buffer_bytes`, `load_llir_buckets`, `type ProfileMetric`) and
replaces the lot with ONE required method,
`compile(&mut self, space, dyn_map, options, rng)`, whose contract is *"choose
one program per bucket of `space` — by any strategy — and leave the runtime
ready to `execute`."* On this branch the analogous surface is `PlanProfiler`
(`src/implementation_search.rs:386-408`) plus core's own GA loop
(`search_implementations_with_runtime`, `:781-1073`), the byte-move cost model
(`src/extractor.rs:1684-1719`), `dps_rewrite`, `bufferize` and the
deterministic extractor. The requirement is the same INVERSION — a pull-style
machine the runtime drives, with the runtime owning candidate evaluation — not
main's trait shape.

**(3) `extract_one` as the zero-ranking strategy.** `extract_one(space, ctx,
rng)` (`f285d229:src/search/mod.rs:218-226`) is the complete "search" for a
runtime with nothing to rank on, and main's reference runtime uses it with
`CLEANUP_HLIR = false`. This branch DIVERGES by decision: the reference
runtime IS the profiling template (ruling: CL "must mirror the reference
profiler's design"), and the deterministic
`extract_layout_ir_with_ops_and_matchers` (`src/extractor.rs:482`) already
fills the fixture/golden role. Recorded as a deliberate divergence, not an
oversight.

**(4) The GA as runtime-local code.** Main's `GeneticSearch<'a, M>` is a
pull-style state machine (`src/search/genetic.rs`) generic over the metric,
with `Finalists` and `BucketLattice` beside it. The branch's loop is NOT
equivalent to it at any setting — main hunts a single viable initial genome
(panicking after 100 attempts), counts MEASURED rather than sampled
candidates with a `count_choice_sets_up_to` cap and a truncated last
generation, dedups genome and program before hand-out at no budget cost,
forces a random resample after a measurement-less generation, and panics on
exhaustion where this branch returns `Err`. Twenty-one `harness_search_options()`
call sites in 14 files and every seeded cuBLASLt election pin depend on the
branch's trajectory, so the machine to lift is the BRANCH's loop, with main's
budget fields added opt-in later and only where a device evaluator consumes
them.

**(5) Buckets.** `SearchSpace.buckets` (one saturated e-graph per bucket
combination), `BucketContext`, `bucket_index_combinations` and the
interval-narrowing that precedes each saturation are a pure addition here;
carry the space field when the artifact lands, mount `bind_dim_buckets` and
execute-time `select_bucket` only when a decode-shaped example demands it, and
require disjoint buckets at bind time (main's `select_bucket` is first-wins on
overlap).

### DROPPED

- **All loop machinery**, by ruling: `src/search/unroll.rs` (1059 lines:
  `collect_loop_regions`, `materialize_unrolled_view`, `unroll_packed_llir`,
  `unroll_loops_in_llir`, `collapse_loops_to_first_iter`,
  `materialize_unrolled_llir`) and the auto loop-rolling prepass
  (`f285d229:src/graph.rs:1590`). The branch has no loop-rolling stage at all.
- **`src/search/packed.rs`** (`PackedLLIRGraph`, `LlirFingerprint`): LLIR-shaped,
  and the branch's `plan_fingerprint` (`src/extractor.rs:884-928`) is already a
  full structural hash of the deployment plan and already the dedup key.
- **`SearchSpace.custom_ops: Vec<LLIROp>`**: no custom ops on this branch.
- **The LLIR diagnostics family** — `Candidate.llir`/`pre_collapse`,
  `Finalist.llir`/`pre_unroll`, `BucketLLIR`, `LLIR_DUMP_DIR`,
  `LLIR_DUMP_PRE_UNROLL`, `LUMINAL_LOG_LLIR`, `LUMINAL_CANDIDATE_OPS`,
  `dump_failed_candidate`, `log_candidate_ops`, `log_best_llir`,
  `maybe_dump_selected_llir`, the `ProgressBars` choreography,
  `panic_initial_filter_limit`. The branch's refusal anatomy
  (`RefusalBreakdown`, `failure_breakdown`, `SearchTimings`, `to_dot`/`ToHtml`)
  and #391's `SearchProgress` are the re-expression, and the branch returns
  `Err` rather than panicking.
- **Main's `Runtime` trait shape** and `compile(space, dyn_map, options, rng)`
  as a signature: the branch ladder is `load -> bind_* -> search -> set_data ->
  execute -> get_*`, and the seam is `search()` driving a core machine with the
  rng seeded inside.
- **`spec.md` / `AGENTS.md` text**: describes the other architecture (see
  **#404 spec.md**, and the out-of-date note now at the top of `spec.md`).
- **Main's 900-trace-line fidelity harness claim**: not in the tree.

## #422 reusable CUDA runtime — banked into the park; the arena is the only intent

Main's `598e5ca7` (+3285/-4026, 42 files) makes the CUDA runtime REUSABLE by a
closed-source superset: `CudaRuntime` becomes `CudaRuntimeImpl<O>` over an op
tuple, thirty-odd internals go `pub #[doc(hidden)]`, five full-only kernels and
the sink-attention/FA3 stack LEAVE Lite, one shared intermediate arena replaces
the per-bucket ones, and elementwise fusion is turned on with a destructive
egglog rule. It builds directly on #420's runtime-side search, which is why
#420 is banked first.

RULED 2026-09-03, four ways: *"put these fusion changes in hlir and punt on
them temporarily... just put this in the hlir folder for now and we'll handle
implementing it once we're up to date with main"*; *"we're going to copy it
into the hlir folder and then actually implement it once we're caught up"*
(attention/FA3); *"Update the hlir_folder so we have a record of what the
target code looks like"* (the full-CUDA downstream); *"no code for now"*
(zero-copy rebinding). So this row is a bank, with exactly one intent carried
forward — the arena — and one already-ruled ledger consequence: #401 is
superseded (see **#401 persistent arena**, amended above).

### FILE-LEVEL: 41 park files (+3284/-4025) and one `ci/` line

All 41 `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/**` files path-rewritten into
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/`, INCLUDING the five deletions applied as
deletions under the park path:
`src/host/flashinfer/{sink_attention.egg, sink_attention.rs, wrapper_fa3.cu,
wrapper_fa3.h}` and `src/kernel/moe_gemv.rs`. Two of those could not be
deleted by patch — the park's copies carry the `Expression` -> `IntExpr`
re-spelling, so the whole-file deletion hunk does not match; each was diffed
against main first to prove the drift is ONLY that re-spelling, then removed
with `git rm`.

Eleven files conflicted; the park has drifted and every conflict was resolved
to main's content in park spellings. Every re-spelling the resolution
would otherwise have dropped was restored and re-verified mechanically
(`cx.tensor(shape, DType)` / `named_tensor(name, shape, DType)` for main's
`.as_dtype`, `IntExpr` for `Expression`), including in lines main ADDS.
Residue against main's own diff: the `Symbol` -> `char` dyn-dim key
convention, one
`luminal::mask_events::ALIAS_HAZARD_REJECT.record()` line the park had lost
and now regains, and two hunks git split differently whose resulting text is
byte-identical to main's. Nothing else. Not a workspace member; nothing
builds.

`ci/example_output.py:27` takes its one-line hunk file-level: qwen3_moe
`max_tpot_ms` 35.0 -> 50.0 (TTFT unchanged). Per the standing ci ruling this
SYNCS main's number and gates nothing here. Its cause is worth recording:
#422 removes `KernelMoEGemv` from Lite, so qwen3_moe decode falls back to the
`GLUMoE` host op or gathered `GenericMatmul`s and gets slower — main relaxed
its own gate to match. The figure still has to be re-baselined against CL A100
draws before it ever gates anything on this branch.

### INTENT: the arena, and runtime-configurable op selection

**(1) One runtime-owned slab in the CUDA runtime, as a separate alloc/free ->
slice mapper.** #422's form is the target: `SharedArena { allocation, pool }`
at runtime scope, grow-only, sized to `peak_planned_arena_bytes` = the max of
`planned_allocation_bytes` over ALL retained buckets, with buckets holding
non-owning `bound_arena_ptr` views; the base moves only inside
`ensure_shared_arena_capacity`, which first destroys every bucket's CUDA
graphs and synchronizes. Search is the exception and deliberately reverses
#401: `release_search_candidate_allocations` frees after every candidate and
`discard_search_bucket_compilation_state` at every bucket boundary, because
*"a slow copying alternative can require several GiB more than the eventual
winner, and retaining that losing arena starves later candidate
compilation."* At row time (p0, `5b0e3c25`) CL was nowhere near this: `execute_plan`
(`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs`) materializes one fresh
`alloc_zeros` per `BufferId` per execute and treats the plan's `BufferAlloc` /
`BufferFree` nodes as explicit no-ops. The re-expression is a runtime-owned
slab in `device.rs` that honours those nodes — a separate alloc/free -> slice
MAPPER, never plan-level offsets, because geometry back into the plan is
rejected by the 2026-08-31 bufferizer correction (`src/bufferize.rs:124-130`).
Two things the spec must get right: exclusion from the slab keys on
`FreedBy::Caller`, not `Owner::Caller`, and the issue order must be
liveness-aware or the slab is a sum-of-buffers peak with extra steps.

DELIVERED 2026-09-03 — Phase 3 (`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/arena.rs`'s
`plan_arena` plus the `BufferAlloc` / `BufferFree` arms in `device.rs`, a
grow-only slab on the persistent `CudaDevice`; both spec points honoured — the
exclusion keys on `FreedBy::Caller` and the order is liveness-aware), and the
per-candidate `release_slab()` of Phase 4. See **Program: #420/#422 rejoin —
Phase 3 (the arena and the persistent device)** and **Phase 4**.

**(2) Configurable op / matcher selection at runtime init.** Main's answer is
a type tuple (`CudaRuntimeImpl<O: IntoEgglogOp>`, `DefaultCudaOps =
(kernel::Ops, host::Ops)`, `CudaDynBackend<O>`, `cuda_factory_for`). The
intent — a downstream backend picks its op set and inherits the compiler,
resource planner, arena, graph capture and search — is carried; the TYPE
tuple is not (see DROPPED). The branch form is a value-level registry —
DELIVERED as `load_with_registry` / `cuda_registry_filtered` /
`RegisteredOp::new`, see **Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 2 (configurable
registry)**. The estate already composes that way (`assembled_program_for` over
any matcher list) and branch ops carry their rules as `.egg` files rather than
Rust methods. The SECOND half — an execution face injected at load, which is
what would let the refactor delete the two closed seams that exist today (the
`host_dispatchable` prototype DOWNCAST in `ops/cublaslt/mod.rs`, never a name
list, and the executor's `CublasLtDps` downcast arm in `device.rs`) — is
PUNTED; see Phase 2, *The punt, recorded*. Both seams are live at the tip
(`runtime.rs`'s `allow_list_over`, `device.rs`'s host-call arm). Land the
execution face BEFORE flipping cuBLASLt always-on, or always-on lands as a
third registry function the refactor immediately deletes.

**(3) Fusion — PUNTED to the park, by ruling.** #422 turns on the first
multi-op fusion Lite has ever had: a singleton region per eligible elementwise
op (now including flat `Cast`), and one destructive rule
`inline-safe-FE-through-FS` that `union`s a `FusionStart(FusionEnd(x))`
boundary with the producer's interior and `subsume`s the boundary spelling,
run as a single late pass over the saturated e-graph. Eleven previously
`#[ignore]`d fusion tests are re-enabled and four are INVERTED to assert no
materialized boundary survives. It is banked verbatim in the park and will be
implemented once this branch is caught up with main; the form it takes here is
a separate question (see DROPPED for why the rule itself is not adopted).

**(4) Attention / FA3 — PUNTED to the park, by ruling.** The sink-attention
`HostOp`, its 232-line `.egg`, the FA3 wrapper ABI, and the generic
`FlashInferJitSource` / `compile_flashinfer_source` replacement, together with
the new `HostOp::{execute_with_id, output_dtype, cuda_graph_capture_*,
prepare_cuda_graph_*}` hooks, `CudaGraphCaptureSharedState`, host mirrors
(`set_data_with_host_mirror`), the shared dyn-dims buffer and `uses_input`.
None of it is reachable on CL — no attention op, no CUDA-graph capture, no
JIT/nvcc — so it is a record of the target, not a requirement yet. One piece
is already-equivalent here: `output_dtype` is a declared fact
(`CudaLayout.dtype`), not a query. The ruling that must PRECEDE any vendor
attention op is the float contract for library attention (online softmax is
not bit-equal to the chain; see `reduction-order-contract` and the vendor
matching gap ledger), not anything in #422.

**(5) Zero-copy output rebinding — RECORDED, no code.** #422 fixes a real bug:
a dynamic output that grows keeps its stale `External` resolution through
`prepare_bucket_buffers`, so the arena skips the node and the refresh applies
the larger logical length to a view whose capacity is the previous request's
byte count. Main's fix is `detach_dirty_external_output_bindings`, which drops
the stale resolution so the arena rebinds at planned capacity before the new
external view is installed. Not reachable here (no external output pointers on
CL); folded into **#418** requirement 3 as a contract sentence — registrations
carry `(ptr, capacity)`, growth re-registers rather than patching — with no
runtime checks by ruling.

**(6) Cuda-heavy composition — punted.** The `pub #[doc(hidden)]` surface
(`cuda_dtype`, `compile_module_image_for_current_device`,
`device_compute_major`, `eval_resource_expression`, `DeviceBuffer::capacity`,
`KernelRoPE::from_parts`, `swiglu_chain_atoms`, `apply_rope_half_as`) exists
to let an external superset layer kernels on Lite's codegen. Recorded as the
shape of the target; nothing here yet has a downstream to serve.

### DROPPED

- **Destructive fusion as landed**: the `union` + `subsume`
  `inline-safe-FE-through-FS` rule, the `fusion_inline_safe_late` late pass,
  `safe_fusion_late_pass`, the singleton-`Cast` region rule and the eleven
  un-ignored / four inverted fusion tests. Parked, not adopted. It is a
  heuristic dressed as cleanup: it removes a form extraction may want, it is
  keyed on `?shape ?stride ?dt` spelling equality, and it fails the cleanup
  stratum's every-cost-model dominance bar. Even the narrow single-consumer
  case has no expressible premise — egglog has no negation, `!=` is a
  snapshot, and the estate carries no use-count facts. Main's own shared
  interiors are recomputed per region by design, which is a cost-model
  concern, not an invariant violation. The door left open is a fused-region
  FORM elected by cost, after an A100 launch-overhead measurement — never a
  destructive rule.
- **The four `delete` rules** added in the same commit ("kernel argmax last
  axis", "prefer fused argmax over decomposed max", "kernel stable ranks
  descending", "kernel rms norm bf16"). Same doctrine — removal by fiat, not
  by measurement — and none of those kernels exists on CL.
- **`CudaRuntimeImpl<O: IntoEgglogOp>`**, `DefaultCudaOps`, `CudaDynBackend<O>`,
  `cuda_factory_for`, and the `#[doc(hidden)]` accessors as a TYPE-level
  extension axis. Parked. A tuple buys nothing here: no `DynBackend` exists on
  this branch, and registry rows express the same thing at value level.
- **The full-only kernel removals themselves** (`KernelGemvF8`,
  `KernelMoEGemv`, `KernelRMSNormQuant`, `KernelSwigluQuant`,
  `KernelRoPEScatterFused`), the `KernelArgmax` shared-memory fix, the cuBLASLt
  autotune REPS/events change, `load_safetensors` dtype conversion: N/A —
  none of those kernels exists on CL, which is primitive kernels by
  construction. The park receives them file-level.
- **Main's resource planner shape** (plan-level offsets,
  `prepare_static_llir_resources`, `validate_resource_plan`) and
  `DeviceBuffer{len, capacity}` with `with_logical_len`: geometry back into the
  plan is rejected here; the capacity vocabulary arrives with #418 req 3 if
  ever.
- **Two-stage ranking** (`rerank_cuda_graph_finalists`,
  `profile_finalist_cuda_graph`), `search_candidate_node_limit`, and
  `bounded_search_intermediate_bytes` / `search_cache_under_pressure`: no CUDA
  graphs on CL, and a live-memory-dependent cap makes the search space
  run-to-run nondeterministic. Noted for the on-device profiler phase, not
  adopted.
- **`detach_dirty_external_output_bindings`**: not reachable; folded into #418
  requirement 3 as a sentence (above).

## Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 3 (persistent device + arena)

**The move.** The CUDA-lite runtime got a device that outlives a call and
a memory plan. Before this, every `execute` built a fresh `CudaContext`,
a fresh `KernelCache` (so every kernel was recompiled from source), and
one `alloc_zeros` per plan buffer — every buffer live for the whole call,
which is the SUM of everything the plan names. The bufferizer had been
computing lifetimes (`BufferAlloc` opens storage, `BufferFree` closes it,
the containment certificate puts every toucher between the two) and
nothing consumed them. #422's arena consumes them.

**Austin's rulings this implements** (2026-09-03). "The arena lives in
the cuda runtime… first produce the bufferizer, this will do the
allocations / frees. Then a separate thing will map those allocation /
frees to slices on memory in the arena allocator." "Runtime owns this
code. Try to factor it into a reasonable module." "Buckets will always be
concrete, not symbolic, so we should be good on sizing." #401 as
superseded by #422: ONE runtime-owned slab, grow-only, never parked.
Zero-copy rebinding: "let's not implement any checks in the runtime… I
don't want to touch this code unnecessarily, let's keep it simple" — no
new invariant checks were added; the one existing check was re-scoped
(below). Each runtime remembers its own buffer hygiene.

### What landed

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/arena.rs` (new) | The device-free planning pass. `plan_arena(plan, bytes_of) -> ArenaPlan`, generic over `L: PlanLayout`, no cudarc — it compiles and its five tests run on a laptop. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs` | `CudaDevice` (context + one stream + module cache + slab), `execute_plan(&mut CudaDevice, plan, staged)`, arena-bound storage, the kernel-invariant record. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/runtime.rs` | One field: `device: Option<CudaDevice>`, created on the first `execute`. `CudaRuntime: Default` unchanged. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/ops/cublaslt/device_call.rs` | `dispatch` takes `DeviceRange` (pointer + length) instead of `&CudaSlice`/`&mut CudaSlice`. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/lib.rs` | `pub mod arena;` |

`ArenaPlan` is `{ order: Vec<NodeIndex>, slab_bytes, peak_live_bytes,
slices: FxHashMap<BufferId, ArenaSlice{offset, bytes}>, standalone:
Vec<BufferId>, donated: Vec<BufferId> }`. `bytes_of` is the caller's, so
tests plan with mock sizes and the executor passes the one real rule
(`literal_span_elements() * dtype_bytes`) — the same closure the arena
and Phase 1 both call, so the two can never disagree about a size.
Alignment is 256 bytes. `peak_live_bytes` is diagnostic: the largest
total of simultaneously-live reservations, i.e. what a perfect allocator
would need, so the gap against `slab_bytes` prices fragmentation.

### The ownership rows: only one is recyclable

| row | `Owner` | `FreedBy` | alloc | free | arena |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BOUNDARY | `Caller` | `Caller` | — | — | `standalone` |
| DONATED | `Caller` | `Program` | — | yes | `donated` |
| ESCAPING | `System` | `Caller` | yes | — | `standalone` |
| INTERIOR | `System` | `Program` | yes | yes | **slab member** |

Only INTERIOR has both ends of its lifetime inside the program, which is
the precondition for handing its bytes to a later buffer. ESCAPING bytes
are the caller's from return on — re-letting them would hand the caller a
range the next call overwrites. DONATED storage came from the caller and
the program's free RELEASES it; that is not a licence to re-let it (in CL
the "caller's slice" is the device copy of the staged host payload, so it
is allocated in Phase 1 like the standalone rows and simply never
recycled). An INTERIOR buffer whose alloc/free pair is missing from the
dag — a hand-built or externally loaded plan — is DEMOTED to standalone,
which is exactly CL-2's behaviour, so those plans still run and
`slab_bytes` is 0.

### The order policy, and the thing that was measured

The issue order is the arena's, not `petgraph::algo::toposort`'s. Raw
toposort is legal and terrible: allocs have in-degree zero, Kahn hoists
every one of them to the front, and the high-water mark equals the sum
(verdict C7). The policy is:

1. a `BufferFree` whose in-edges are discharged goes FIRST (its in-edges
   are Data from the final resident's producer plus Anti from every other
   toucher, so this is "free the instant the last toucher has run");
2. a `BufferAlloc` **is never queued at all — it is PULLED**: its edge to
   its first toucher is left out of that toucher's in-degree, and popping
   the toucher emits its not-yet-issued alloc predecessors immediately
   before it;
3. ties break on node index — the bufferizer's own emission order.

**Rule 2 is the finding.** Queueing allocs at the LOWEST priority is not
enough, and the first cut did exactly that. The frontier stalls
constantly (every compute node waits on its own destination's alloc), so
the scheduler must issue *some* alloc, and a node-index tie-break issues
one whose toucher is nowhere near ready. Measured on a two-layer
mini-llama block (d=128, 484 plan nodes) on the A100: the six d×ff weight
materializations were allocated at positions 1..27 and first TOUCHED at
447..475; median lifetime was 233 of 484 nodes; the high-water mark came
to 1 823 744 B against a naive sum of 1 845 482 B — a 1% saving. Peak-live
equalled the high-water almost exactly, so it was never fragmentation:
the order really was holding everything live. With the pull, on the same
plan: median lifetime 6 nodes, high-water 596 480 B.

Against bufferize's own node-index placement (the alternative the brief
named): on the CPU chain fixture both give the peak (2 048 B for five
1 000 B buffers; raw toposort gives 5 120 B = the sum). The pulled order
is never worse there, and unlike node-index order it is a topological
order by construction on any plan, so it ships. The test asserts all
three numbers.

The allocator is first fit over the free list in offset order, coalescing
both neighbours on a free and growing through a tail hole rather than
stranding it. **Best fit was tried and is WORSE** — 663 040 B against
596 480 B on the same plan, because it shaves every large hole into
slivers nothing later fits into. Recorded at the allocator. The next move,
if this is ever worth more, is offset assignment over whole lifetimes
(the greedy-by-size arena planners), which is a different pass rather
than a different line.

### The kernel invariant

A recycled range arrives holding the previous occupant's bytes, so NO
memset is emitted anywhere and every family had to be audited (the record
lives at the top of `device.rs`):

- **elementwise / cast / constant / iota / gather / index-map
  materialize / copy** — one thread per destination element, `out[i] =
  <expr>` over `n = numel(dest_dims)`; and the destination is not even
  passed to the launch (the executor hands the kernel
  `reads[..reads.len()-writes.len()]`, which drops the DPS dest operand),
  so it cannot be read;
- **reduce** — `out[i] = acc` over `n = outer*inner`, the whole
  destination, `acc` seeded from `init`;
- **scatter** — two launches: the first is `out[i] = init[...]` over the
  FULL destination numel (a rank/extent mismatch bails), so the
  destination is completely written before the second launch scatters
  into it; same stream, so the phases are ordered;
- **cuBLASLt D** — `beta = 0` on the non-fold forms, which is the BLAS
  skip (C, aliased to D, is not read); the C-fold forms read their C
  operand at `beta = 1`. AMENDED 2026-09-03 (review finding C13): C is a
  DEFINED resident — usually a distinct live range, but D's own range
  when the program binds an output slot onto the ReadWrite caller buffer
  that holds C, admitted through `CublasLtDps`'s May permit on operand 2
  and legal because `bind_destination` emits identical C and D
  descriptors (the API's C == D precondition). Never an undefined
  recycled range, which is the property this bullet is for; the earlier
  "C != D pointers" wording was the pre-arena fresh-slice justification.

Standing assumption, recorded rather than checked: a destination's
`numel(dest_dims)` covers its buffer's SPAN. True for every codegen'd
kernel because the elected destination layout must be right-major
contiguous (the egglog write-capability guard, 2026-09-01) and for
cuBLASLt because `bind_destination` admits only the two dense orders. A
future non-dense destination would leave the span's tail holding the
previous occupant's bytes and would need the memset this note says we do
not do.

### CONTRACT-1: re-scoped, not dropped, not duplicated

The whole-plan `binding_check::assert_disjoint` at bind time would now
fire BY DESIGN — every slab member is a sub-range of one allocation. It
was not the right question for them either: what folded-view reads and
WAR ordering need is that two SIMULTANEOUSLY BOUND `BufferId`s do not
share a byte. So the check splits along the same seam as the memory:

- the executor still runs `assert_disjoint` over the allocations IT makes
  (the standalone and donated rows) — the raw-pointer binding surface the
  module was written for, one call per execute;
- the slab's half is decided at PLANNING time, in `arena.rs`, as each
  range is carved: the live set is kept sorted by offset and the new
  range is checked against its two neighbours (a sorted disjoint set stays
  disjoint iff every insertion clears its neighbours). O(log k) per alloc,
  device-free, and it refuses with the same CONTRACT-1 vocabulary.

No other check was added. `BufferFree` drops the binding, so a plan that
reads a freed buffer gets a loud "no live binding" instead of stale bytes;
that is the absence of stale state, not a new fence. The owned
allocations themselves are held to the end of the call.

### Bindings are pointers now

A slab range is a BORROW of one allocation, and no set of
`CudaView`/`CudaViewMut` handles can coexist under the borrow checker
when a launch reads several ranges and writes another. Storage is
therefore `(pointer, length)`: pushing the pointer as a kernel argument
is ABI-identical to pushing a `&CudaSlice` (cudarc pushes exactly that
`CUdeviceptr`), copies go through `cudarc::driver::result::memcpy_*_async`
on the one stream — the same calls cudarc's own safe wrappers make — and
the stream-event bookkeeping those handles carry is inert here, because
CL issues everything on one stream and
`is_managing_stream_synchronization()` is false. A multi-stream executor
would owe those events; that is written down at the type.

### Measurements (A100, `LUMINAL_CL_ARENA=1`)

mini-llama blocks through the real ladder (load → search at the harness
budget → execute), all numbers in bytes:

| plan | nodes | interior buffers | interior SUM | slab high-water | peak live | whole-plan sum (CL-2) | total now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 d128 | 257 | 84 | 907 730 | 298 496 | 296 192 | 1 404 382 | 795 148 |
| L2 d128 | 484 | 159 | 1 845 482 | 596 480 | 498 176 | 2 837 750 | 1 588 748 |
| L4 d256 | 872 | 287 | 15 892 710 | 5 254 656 | 5 254 144 | 23 791 858 | 13 153 804 |

The interior row shrinks by 3.0–3.1× and the whole device footprint by
1.77–1.81× (weights and boundary storage are most of what is left, and
they are not the arena's to shrink). Fragmentation is under 1% at L1 and
L4 and 20% at L2. Median buffer lifetime is 6 plan nodes at every size.
The device_fidelity fixtures are all under 1 KB, so 256-byte alignment
dominates there and the slab reads LARGER than the sum; the signal at
that scale is the slot count (5 interior buffers into 3 slots, 3 into 2).

Device suites at `0446476b`, A100-SXM4-40GB: unit 10/10, codegen_identity
13/13, composed_read_families 5/5, cublaslt_bias_premise 3/3,
cublaslt_contracts_cpu 19/19, cublaslt_election 9/9, **device_fidelity
6/6**, **device_view_differentials 4/4**, dim_buckets 4/4, example_smoke
1/1, input_producer_cleanup 5/5, ladder_refusals 3/3 (3 ignored),
plan_smoke 2/2, scc_sampler_marker 1/1, view_admission 4/4.
cublaslt_contracts 5/6: `marker_elected_bias_plan_matches_decomposed_
route_tolerance_based` fails on its ELECTION assert (seed 0 no longer
elects `CublasLtBias`), which is PRE-EXISTING — reproduced at the Phase 1
tip and on a laptop with no GPU, i.e. entirely in the device-free search
path. It is the pin class the 2026-09-02 permutation-invariance ruling
already parked. `all_four_contract_forms_execute_green` passes, so the
`DeviceRange` dispatch is device-verified.

**Also carried** (separate commit): `--features device --all-targets` did
not build at the Phase 1 tip — Step B's `TypedBuffer`→`HostBuffer` swap
left `HostBuffer::F32(values)` in the example support module and the
cuBLASLt contract test, plus a `Vec<f32> == &Vec<f32>` in plan_smoke's
device arm. cudarc builds fine on macOS (dynamic loading), so this is a
laptop gate, not a box-only one.

### Deferred

- **Search-time slab policy** → Phase 4. This pass sizes ONE installed
  plan; sizing across the candidate plans a search evaluates (and whether
  the search should rank on arena footprint at all) is that phase's.
- **Zero-copy outputs.** Phase 4 D2Hs every output slot into a fresh host
  vector, as before. Handing the caller device memory it can keep is the
  ESCAPING row's whole point and nothing here consumes it yet.
- **Symbolic sizing.** `bytes_of` refuses a symbolic span. Buckets are
  concrete by ruling, so nothing needs it today.
- **The 32 MiB cuBLASLt workspace** is still allocated per call inside
  `device_call::dispatch`. Now that the device is persistent it should
  live on `CudaDevice`; it is untouched here because the file belongs to
  the cuBLASLt estate.
- **Multi-stream.** Everything is issued on one stream and the
  recycling's soundness rests on that: issue order IS execution order.
  Events/barriers are owed the day a second stream appears.
- **Kernel-count printing** in the examples' support module counts
  `Compute` nodes including `BufferAlloc`/`BufferFree`; left as is.

## Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 4 (device evaluator)

**The move.** CUDA-lite now profiles candidate plans ON THE DEVICE. Since
CL-1 this runtime's search has ranked by `heuristic::heuristic_cost_of` —
bytes moved over the extracted graph, a weak static prior — and `lib.rs`
carried the debt in writing ("STILL OWED: profiling ON DEVICE, mirroring
the reference evaluator's design"). `CompileOptions::profile_on_device`
discharges it: each candidate plan is compiled, warmed and TIMED on a
real GPU, and the winner is the fastest plan measured, not the plan that
touches the least memory.

**Austin's rulings this implements** (2026-09-03). Ruling 4 on #386: CL
must eventually profile on device *"just like the existing profiler
actually does. we need to mirror that design"* — the reference runtime's
evaluator is the template, not a new invention. D2: the GA stays. D6: the
CL-local device-free evaluator stays, is called `heuristic`, and must
*"not bias search too much"*. Ambiguity 1: *"timeout should just cover
run"*. D10: *"CL search lives in the runtime. Runtimes can choose how to
handle failures at different points."* #422's policy on the slab at
search time, reversing #401's retention. And throughout: keep it simple,
no new traits.

### What landed

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/profile.rs` (new, `#[cfg(feature = "device")]`) | The device evaluator: `profile_candidate(&mut CudaDevice, plan, staged, trials, best_so_far, candidate_timeout) -> Result<Measurement, ProfileFailure>`. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/search.rs` | `CompileOptions::{profile_on_device, candidate_timeout}`; `Evaluator<'_>` (the enum that took over the deleted `PlanProfiler` trait's job); `RefusalBreakdown::timed_out`; `SearchOutcome::best_heuristic_cost`; `early_stop_exceeded` + its test, carried over from the reference copy (Phase 1 had dropped it as dead); the one `profiled` site became a two-arm choice. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/runtime.rs` | `CudaRuntime::search` BUILDS the evaluator: lazily creates `self.device`, stages the caller's payloads by BufferLit id (by reference), and lends both. The bound-input check Phase 1 added stays. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs` | `CudaDevice::release_slab()`; `execute_plan`'s `staged` is now `&FxHashMap<i64, &HostBuffer>`. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/heuristic.rs` | One paragraph: on device it is not consulted at all. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/examples/support/mod.rs` | `run_cuda` profiles on device and prints the winner's measurement beside its heuristic cost. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/tests/device_profile.rs` (new, device-gated) | The probe (below). |

`Measurement` is `Timed { mean_nanos, completed_trials }` or `TimedOut {
elapsed_nanos, completed_trials }`; `ProfileFailure` is `Prepare(err)` or
`Execute(err)`. The evaluator is

```rust
pub enum Evaluator<'a> {
    Heuristic,
    #[cfg(feature = "device")]
    Device { device: &'a mut CudaDevice, staged: &'a FxHashMap<i64, &'a HostBuffer> },
}
```

with a `reborrow(&mut self)` so the bucketed entry can lend the SAME
device to every Cartesian combination. NO TRAIT: there are exactly two
ways this crate prices a plan, both live in this crate, and an enum names
them with an exhaustive match. `search_implementations` takes it as ONE
extra argument and refuses UP FRONT if `profile_on_device` and the
evaluator disagree — a request to measure is never answered with a prior.

### What is mirrored from the reference evaluator, and the two divergences

MIRRORED, from `luminal_reference::search::profile_on_reference_runtime`:
one warmup execution (validity + first-touch), then `trials` timed
executions; the metric is the MEAN over trials (ruling 2, 2026-09-02 — a
mean only rises as trials accumulate, which is what makes the early stop
an exact argument); the early stop applies `early_stop_exceeded` at
factor 1.0 to a LOWER BOUND on the final mean (the sum so far divided by
ALL trials, i.e. assuming every remaining trial is free), so it fires
exactly when the candidate has provably lost.

DIVERGENCE 1 — THE DEVICE IS PERSISTENT, the runtime is not rebuilt. The
reference builds a fresh `ReferenceRuntime` per candidate because its
runtime is a cheap host object. The CL equivalent would throw away the
CUDA context and the NVRTC module cache between candidates and recompile
every kernel — most of a CUDA search's wall time. So Phase 3's device is
REUSED and compilation is paid once per distinct kernel source across the
whole search. What is not carried between candidates is the slab (below).

DIVERGENCE 2 — THE TIMED REGION INCLUDES STAGING AND READBACK.
`execute_plan` is one call that allocates, H2Ds the staged inputs,
launches, synchronizes and D2Hs the outputs; the reference's `execute()`
runs only the kernels because its `set_data_buffer` is a separate ladder
step. Splitting CL's execute into stage-once/run-many is real surgery on
the executor and was NOT done. Stated rather than hidden: the H2D/D2H
term is essentially the same for every candidate (same inputs, same
outputs), so the RANKING is preserved while the absolute numbers are
inflated. Read a CL device measurement as "the cost of one whole
`execute` call" — which is what the serving ladder pays anyway.

### Timeout semantics: the timed RUN, and nothing else

`candidate_timeout` budgets ONLY the timed run. The clock starts at the
FIRST TIMED TRIAL — after compile, stage and warmup — and is read BETWEEN
trials, plus once after the last one (so a single trial longer than the
whole budget is caught too). A trial in flight is never interrupted:
there is no cancel for a launched kernel, so the honest thing is to
finish the trial and then stop.

WHY COMPILE IS OUT. NVRTC time is a once-per-distinct-source cost across
the whole search, paid by whichever candidate happens to hit a cold
module cache. Charging it to that candidate would time out plans for a
cost their successors get for free — the budget would be measuring cache
luck, not the plan.

A timed-out candidate is NOT RANKED. A partial mean under a timeout is a
measurement of the budget, not of the plan. It is counted in a NEW
counter, `RefusalBreakdown::timed_out`, kept apart from
`execute_refusals`: nothing failed, the plan is merely too slow to finish
measuring, and the zero-refusal ladder acceptance stays about failures.
`run_cuda` prints it and does not gate on it.

### Failure handling (D10)

| When | Counted as | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NVRTC compile, module load, staging geometry, escape guard, warmup execution | `plan_build_refusals` | An ordinary unfit candidate. A plan this backend cannot compile or stage is indistinguishable in kind from one bufferize refused; the search drops it and tries others. It never fails the ladder. |
| A TIMED trial, after the warmup already succeeded | `execute_refusals` | The same plan ran once and then did not — an OOM at a larger slab, a launch failure. That is a genuine execution refusal. |
| The timed run exceeded the budget | `timed_out` | Not a failure at all. |

The `RefusalBreakdown::summary()` string gained a `, timed out {n}`
field; `run_cuda`'s gate is unchanged (extract / plan-build / execute).

### The slab at search time

`CudaDevice::release_slab()` is called by the search after EVERY profiled
candidate (#422's policy, reversing #401's retention for this one
caller). One candidate's arena high-water mark therefore cannot hold
device memory for the rest of the search and starve its successors; the
next `execute_plan` re-allocates through `ensure_slab`. SERVING KEEPS IT:
`CudaRuntime::execute` never releases, so the grow-only slab Phase 3
landed is exactly what a served runtime still has. Nothing else is
released — the context, the stream and the module cache all survive,
which is what makes compilation a once-per-source cost.

### The heuristic's bias, reported instead of argued about

D6 says the device-free evaluator must not bias search too much. Taken at
full strength: with `profile_on_device` set, the heuristic is NOT
CONSULTED — no blend, no tie-break, no prior seeding generation 0. It
still runs once per profiled candidate for one reason only: so the
winner's byte-move cost can be REPORTED beside its measurement, as
`SearchOutcome::best_heuristic_cost`. `run_cuda` and the probe print the
pair. That makes the prior's bias a number someone can look at rather
than a claim.

### Options: nothing existing moved

`CompileOptions::default()` keeps every value it had (generations 8,
generation_size 8, mutations 2, trials 3, seed 0, search_log true) and
gains `profile_on_device: false`, `candidate_timeout: None`.
`harness_search_options()` is unchanged in behaviour. The eight
exhaustive struct literals in the suites took `..Default::default()`.
Every CPU trajectory is byte-for-byte the one it was, which the suites
pin.

`execute_plan`'s `staged` became a map of REFERENCES. The search stages
the CALLER's payload map, and for a full-size model that is gigabytes of
weights on the host; a map of owned payloads would have meant a second
copy of them for the length of the search. One pointer per input instead.

### A100 (branch `rejoin/p4-device-evaluator`, `8b49752d`)

`cargo test -p luminal_cuda_lite --features device --no-fail-fast`: every
suite green except one PRE-EXISTING failure (below) — lib 11, codegen 13,
composed_read_families 5, cublaslt_bias_premise 3, cublaslt_contracts 5
passed / 1 FAILED, cublaslt_contracts_cpu 19, cublaslt_election 9,
device_fidelity 6, **device_profile 2**, device_view_differentials 4,
dim_buckets 4, example_smoke 1, input_producer_cleanup 5,
ladder_refusals 3 (+3 ignored), plan_smoke 2, registry_selection 4,
scc_sampler_marker 1, view_admission 4 + 1.

THE PROBE, `tests/device_profile.rs` on the mini-llama3 decode block
(embedding gather, QKV, KV-cache scatter/gather, attention, SwiGLU,
output projection) at the 2x4 harness budget with `profile_on_device`:

```
debug:   search 12017 ms | plans profiled 6 | fingerprint hits 2
  [analysis 88ms, extract 1207ms, plan-build 5996ms, profile-exec 3411ms]
  winner 3.559355 ms measured on device
release: search  5504 ms | plans profiled 6 | fingerprint hits 2
  [analysis 19ms, extract 152ms, plan-build 1090ms, profile-exec 3352ms]
  winner 0.974485 ms measured on device
refusals extract 0 (choice-cycles 0, dead-ends 0), bufferize 0, execute 0, timed out 0
```

Six plans profiled on the GPU, ZERO compile/stage/warmup failures, zero
execute failures, zero timeouts, and the elected plan still matches the
reference runtime's logits to the fidelity battery's tolerance (1e-5
relative). PROFILE-EXEC IS THE SEARCH'S LARGEST TERM IN RELEASE — 3.35 s
of 5.50 s, 61%, where it used to be ~0. Note what is inside it: the
PREPARE execute compiles this plan's kernels through NVRTC, so
`SearchTimings::profile_nanos` is measurement PLUS first-compile, not
measurement alone. Only the trials are timed for RANKING; the timings
struct is coarser than the metric.

THE PRIOR AND THE MEASUREMENT DISAGREE, which is the point:

```
the PRIOR would elect a plan of 10465553 bytes moved;
the MEASUREMENT elected one of 11709143
  (DIFFERENT — the measurement did not pick the prior's winner)
```

Same seed, same budget, same six candidates; the only difference is what
decides. The plan the device timed fastest moves ~12% MORE bytes than the
one the byte-move heuristic would have crowned. That is D6's worry
measured on hardware rather than argued: on this backend the prior was
not merely imprecise, it was electing a different plan. (Reported, never
asserted — which plan measures fastest is device- and noise-dependent,
and pinning it would pin the noise.)

The second probe pins the timeout semantics: `candidate_timeout:
Some(Duration::ZERO)` times EVERY candidate out, so none is ranked and
the search refuses NAMING THE TIMEOUT rather than reporting an execution
failure.

NO FULL-SIZE EXAMPLE WAS RUN, for two independent reasons from the
2026-09-01 sizing work: llama3-8B in f32 is ~32 GB of weights on a 40 GB
A100 and the sizing verdict was "no fused matmul + pre-alloc-everything
=> decode weights x2", i.e. it does not fit; and the one example that HAS
passed full-size (yolo_v11n) took 94 minutes of search under the
HEURISTIC, which device profiling only lengthens. A full-size
device-profiled run is an hours-scale exercise and belongs to its own
sitting.

TRUNK ATTRIBUTION for the cuBLASLt election pin. Phase 3 found
`cublaslt_contracts::marker_elected_bias_plan_matches_decomposed_route_tolerance_based`
failing at the Phase 1 tip. Run at TRUNK (`logical-ssa-project`,
`acde9ac1`) it fails IDENTICALLY — "the fused route must elect
CublasLtBias for this comparison (seed 0 measured electing on the CPU
pin)". So it is a PRE-EXISTING TRUNK FAILURE, not a rejoin regression:
the election that the seed-0 pin records no longer happens. Attribution
only; not fixed here. The bias-premise sweep (`cublaslt_bias_premise`, 3
tests) passes on both, which is the test that exists precisely to say how
election-dependent that pin is.

### Deferred

- **CUDA-EVENT TIMING.** The trials are timed HOST-SIDE with `Instant`
  around `execute_plan`, which synchronizes the stream before it returns,
  so the host clock is honest about the device work. Events would measure
  the same interval minus host-side launch overhead. A refinement, not a
  correction — and it would want the stage/run split (next item) to be
  worth much.
- **STAGE-ONCE / RUN-MANY.** Divergence 2. Splitting `execute_plan` into
  a staging phase and a launch phase would let the timed region be the
  kernels alone, which is what the reference times, and would stop
  re-H2Ding a full-size model's weights on every trial. It is executor
  surgery and is the single biggest remaining fidelity gap between the
  two evaluators.
- **The full-size examples' search cost.** `run_cuda` now measures on
  device, which multiplies a full-size search's wall time by roughly
  (1 warmup + `trials` executes) per distinct plan. At the 2x4 harness
  budget with `trials: 1` that is ~2 whole model executions per profiled
  plan. The yolo_v11n baseline (search 94 min under the heuristic,
  2026-09-01) says a full-size device-profiled search is an hours-scale
  run.
- **Finalists / BucketLattice.** Not adopted. A two-tier scheme (rank
  everything by the heuristic, then re-measure the top k on device) would
  cut device time, but it puts the prior back on the critical path —
  exactly what D6 warns about — and it was not asked for.
  *(SUPERSEDED by Phase 5, below — Austin's D8 on this deferral was
  "defer temporarily, but then add". What landed there is the finalist
  fallback and the aggregate set constraint, NOT the two-tier
  heuristic-then-measure scheme this bullet argues against; the prior
  never returns to the critical path.)*
- **Two-tier graph re-ranking** (measure at one shape, extrapolate to
  others) — not adopted, same reason plus the static-plan limitation
  buckets already carry.
- **`best_nanos` is a union type in spirit.** Under the heuristic it is a
  byte count with a unit-shaped name; under device profiling it is
  nanoseconds. `best_heuristic_cost` now lets a reader tell which, but
  the field is still called `best_nanos`. Renaming it is a wider API
  change than this phase wanted.
- **The fingerprint cache** dedups identical plans across genomes, so a
  repeated plan is measured ONCE and its first measurement is reused.
  With device noise that is a deliberate choice (one measurement per
  distinct plan, not per genome); re-measuring and averaging is the
  alternative nobody asked for.

## Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 5 (finalists + bucket lattice)

**The move.** Phase 4 landed the device evaluator and deferred main's
`Finalists` / `BucketLattice` pair in writing ("**Finalists /
BucketLattice.** Not adopted."). Austin's D8 on that deferral was *"defer
temporarily, but then add"*. This is the "then add". CUDA-lite's search
now keeps a RANKED list of genomes rather than only the winner, and what
gets INSTALLED is chosen by a best-first walk over the buckets' finalist
ranks under one aggregate constraint.

**Why a runtime with buckets needs one.** Until now each bucket installed
its own GA winner. That is right exactly while nothing constrains the
buckets JOINTLY. This runtime has one such resource: `CudaDevice` keeps a
single grow-only arena slab for its whole life and `ensure_slab` grows it
to whatever the plan being executed needs, so a runtime serving several
bucket plans ends up holding `max` over their `slab_bytes`. A caller's
device budget therefore applies to the SET, and no single bucket's search
can see the number it must meet.

### What landed

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/finalists.rs` (new) | `Finalists<'a>` + `PendingFinalist`: one bucket's ranked genomes, re-materialized ONE AT A TIME (`extract_next` / `accept` / `reject` / `ensure(target, validate)` / `take` / `failure_message`). |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/lattice.rs` (new) | `BucketLattice<'a>` + `BucketSet` + `sum_metrics`: `new(buckets, aggregate)`, `next(validate)`, `reject(set, reason, validate)`, `slab_bytes(set)`, `ranks(set)`, `select(set)`, `failure_message()`. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/search.rs` | `CompileOptions::{keep_finalists (default 4), device_budget_bytes (default None)}`; `SearchOutcome::{ranked, lattice_rejections}`; `rank_insert`; `finalist_validate`, `validate_set`, `select_finalist_set` (the driver loop); `BucketPlan::{plan, finalist_rank, slab_bytes}`; `bucket_label`. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/runtime.rs` | `CudaRuntime::search` runs the lattice on BOTH paths and installs its choice; `select_bucket_plan` loads `BucketPlan::plan` (the installed finalist), not `outcome.best_plan`. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/arena.rs` | `buffer_bytes` MOVED here from `device.rs` (it was `fn`-private and device-gated). It is device-free and now has two callers: the executor and the finalists' arena planning, which must run on a laptop for a budget to be checkable without a GPU. One rule, one place. |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/tests/finalists_lattice.rs` (new, CPU) | The four pins (below). |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/tests/device_profile.rs` | One device-gated case: the hard filter warms up on device, and the budget is enforced against real slabs. |

### The aggregate and the constraint

The aggregate is `sum_metrics` — Σ of the per-bucket metrics, saturating.
It must be COORDINATE-MONOTONE (raising one coordinate to a slower
finalist must not lower the aggregate), which Σ over nonnegative metrics
is; that is what makes "expand into one-coordinate-slower successors,
always pop the strictly-smallest aggregate" enumerate the lattice in
nondecreasing cost order. A `visited` set stops a point entering the
frontier along two paths, so no set is proposed twice.

The constraint is `max_i(arena_i.slab_bytes) <= device_budget_bytes`.
THE ALTERNATIVE READING WAS CONSIDERED AND REJECTED: adding each plan's
standalone (boundary + escaping) allocations to its slab. Those buffers
are allocated inside one `execute_plan` call and dropped at its end, so
they are never resident across buckets; charging a budget for memory that
is never simultaneously held would be a lie about the resource. The slab
IS the retained footprint. `None` (the default) is unconstrained, which
is every pre-Phase-5 caller.

The FINALIST-level filter (`finalist_validate`) is main's hard filter,
re-expressed: device-free it is trivially satisfied (a candidate that got
this far extracted, bufferized and arena-planned, and there is nothing
further a host with no GPU can check); under `profile_on_device` with a
live device it is ONE warmup `execute_plan` — compile, stage, launch,
synchronize — after which the slab is released, matching the search's own
per-candidate hygiene. `candidate_timeout` is NOT applied here: Phase 4
ruled it covers a TIMED RUN, and a warmup is not one.

### Two deliberate departures from a literal port

RANK 1 IS HANDED OVER, NOT RE-EXTRACTED. Main's `Finalists` builds
another extractor per bucket and re-extracts even the winner. Here the
genetic search already built the winner's plan, and `Finalists::new`
takes it: rank 1 costs one arena plan instead of a whole extraction, and
the extraction session is built LAZILY, on the first genome that actually
needs it. Measured on this crate's CPU suite: the eager version cost
+27 s over a 61 s baseline (`cublaslt_election` alone 36 s -> 49 s); with
the hand-over it is +10 s, and the residue is the arena plan and the plan
clone. It also makes "an unconstrained search installs what it searched"
true by construction rather than by an argument about determinism.

THE UNBUCKETED PATH RUNS THE LATTICE TOO, over one bucket — main's "one
designed difference" from its pre-#420 behaviour, adopted for the same
reason: whether the installed plan fits the caller's budget is a property
of what is installed, and an unbucketed install is a set of one. There is
one selection path to reason about instead of two.

### Dropped from main's version

Everything LLIR-shaped, because this branch has no LLIR: `pre_unroll`
graphs, the `LLIR_DUMP_DIR` / `LLIR_DUMP_PRE_UNROLL` dump machinery in
`Finalists::take` and `BucketLattice::select`, and `unroll` on the
re-extraction path. The ANSI progress bars stay dropped (Phase 4's
`SearchProgress` is kept and unchanged; the lattice adds ONE line, main's
"aggregate fallback" report, printed only when a fallback actually
happened). Main's `search_time_limit` clock over finalization is not
carried — this branch has no such option, and its one timeout is
documented to cover a timed device run only, so it was not re-purposed.

### The reference runtime is deliberately untouched

`luminal_reference` gets none of this. It has NO aggregate resource
across buckets: its executor allocates per call on the host and keeps no
shared arena, so `validate_set` there would be `Ok(())` unconditionally
and the lattice would degenerate to "install each bucket's winner" — the
code it already has, wrapped in machinery that could never reject
anything. Adding it there is a later phase's job, and it should wait
until that runtime has a set-level constraint worth checking.

### Tests

CPU (`tests/finalists_lattice.rs`, 4 tests):

- `an_unconstrained_search_installs_the_searched_winner` — zero
  rejections, `ranked[0]` IS `best_genome`/`best_nanos`, and the
  installed plan's structural signature (node/edge/buffer counts + sorted
  compute labels) equals `best_plan`'s. This is the pin that Phase 5
  costs the existing suites nothing.
- `a_device_budget_forces_the_lattice_to_a_slower_set` — two passes over
  a two-bucket attention-shaped fixture. Pass 1 is unconstrained and
  REPORTS what the winning set needs; pass 2 sets the budget one byte
  under that, so the winning set is refused by construction. The
  installed set must fit, and some bucket must install a rank > 1. The
  budget is self-calibrating rather than a constant, so the test says
  "one byte too little" whatever the planner's numbers become. Measured
  at this fixture and seed: winning slabs `[1280, 2560]`, installed
  `[1280, 1792]` at ranks `[1, 2]` after 2 rejections.
- `a_budget_nothing_meets_refuses_and_names_it` — a zero budget: every
  set rejected, and the error names the budget, says the LATTICE failed
  (not the search), and says why no slower set was tried.
- `keep_finalists_bounds_the_ranked_list` — `keep_finalists: 1` keeps
  one, which is the pre-Phase-5 world exactly.

THE REJECTION COUNT IS A LOWER BOUND, NOT A PIN. Which successor is
proposed after a rejection is decided by the METRIC aggregate, not by the
slabs, so more than one proposal may be over budget before a fitting one
comes up (this fixture: 2). Pinning the exact count would pin the
sampler's ordering, which is the kind of pin the permutation-invariance
ruling (2026-09-02) says not to write.

Device (`tests/device_profile.rs`,
`the_finalist_filter_warms_up_on_device_and_the_budget_is_enforced`): a
zero budget over the mini-llama3 fixture must refuse NAMING THE BUDGET
and NOT naming a warmup — which is the pin that the hard filter passed on
every finalist it materialized, i.e. that each was compiled, staged and
run once on the device before the budget looked at it. Then the same
search with the budget lifted installs rank 1 with zero rejections and
executes.

### Verified on the A100 (2026-09-03)

`93dd7cb1` checked out on the box, `cargo test -p luminal_cuda_lite
--features device --test device_profile --test finalists_lattice`:

```
test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 70.34s
test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 14.42s
```

The Phase 4 probe is unchanged by Phase 5 — mini-llama3, 6 plans
profiled, 2 fingerprint hits, winner 3.617 ms measured, zero refusals —
and the new device case passes, so the finalist hard filter's warmup arm
compiles, stages and runs every finalist it materializes before the
budget is consulted. The CPU lattice case runs identically on the box:
winning slabs `[1280, 2560]` -> installed `[1280, 1792]` at ranks
`[1, 2]` after 2 rejections, which is the same walk the mac produced.
Box returned to `logical-ssa-project`.

### Deferred

- **THE REFERENCE RUNTIME**, above.
- **A SET-LEVEL METRIC OTHER THAN Σ.** `AggregateFn` is a plain `fn`
  pointer and the lattice is generic in it, but there is exactly one
  aggregate in this crate. A weighted sum (buckets are not equally
  likely) is the obvious next one and wants a bucket-frequency model
  nobody has asked for.
- **STANDALONE BYTES IN THE BUDGET.** Rejected above as a lie about the
  resource, but the honest version — a per-execution peak that includes
  the boundary and escaping rows — is a different (and also useful)
  budget, and would want its own option rather than overloading this one.
- **A FALLBACK REASON IN `SearchOutcome`.** The outcome reports HOW MANY
  sets the lattice rejected, not WHY each was rejected; the reasons are
  in the failure message only when the walk fails outright. A structured
  per-rejection record is more accounting than anyone has asked for.
- **`Finalists` HAS NO SYNTHETIC CONSTRUCTOR.** Every finalist comes from
  a real genome, so the lattice's walk order is only exercised through
  real searches. A unit test over hand-built finalists would pin the
  best-first ordering directly; it would also need a public way to inject
  them, which is test scaffolding in the library.

## Program: #420/#422 rejoin — review fix-ups

An adversarial review of the six-branch stack (`rejoin/p0` … `rejoin/p5`)
confirmed 26 findings. They land on `rejoin/p6-review-fixups`, one commit per
code finding plus two doc commits, except C1/C8 which had to move DOWN the
stack — the branch whose commit broke the build is the branch that must repair
it. Four findings are behaviour; the rest are statements in the tree that the
stack's own phases falsified. Listed by number, with where each was fixed.

**Behaviour (code).**

- **C1 / C8 — Step B breaks the CUDA-lite `device` feature build in three
  places (hidden from the CPU gate).** `HostBuffer` became a struct and three
  `cfg(feature = "device")` sites still matched `HostBuffer::F32(values)` /
  compared `Vec<f32>` to `&Vec<f32>`, so no A100 example and no device test
  built from Step B onward. Phase 3 carried the repairs two branches too late,
  and its carry-fix commit named three sites while fixing two. Fixed by a
  fix-up commit at the Phase 1 tip ("Step B fix-up: the HostBuffer swap
  reaches the device-gated files") carrying all three repairs; the stack was
  rebased onto it and Phase 3's carry-fix commit disappeared as empty.
  `cargo build -p luminal_cuda_lite --all-targets --features device` now
  passes at every branch tip.
- **C2 / C9 — `bind_dim_buckets` accepted a dim that already carried a
  non-tight RANGE binding, so the two seed sets intersected under the bounds
  lattice's merge instead of refusing.** Both runtimes now keep `range_bound`
  (every `bind_dyn_range` call with its interval) and refuse buckets on it,
  naming the interval; the leftover `dims` check now says what it actually
  covers (`set_dim`). Commit "Buckets and range bindings are exclusive,
  whatever the interval"; tests in the reference battery (all three arms) and
  `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/tests/dim_buckets.rs`.
- **C3 / C10 — the CUDA-lite bucketed `search` ran a full, discarded
  saturation of the UNBUCKETED program first**, whose bucketed dims carry no
  seeds — so a bounds-dependent authoring check (`reduce_max`'s
  `require_extent_at_least`, an iota's value bounds) refused a bucketed search
  every per-bucket render accepts. The base program is now rendered only on
  the single-pin path and the bound-input check reads `native.input_slots`.
  Commit "The bucketed CUDA search renders no base program"; the new
  `a_bucketed_dim_may_carry_a_bounds_dependent_check` is the witness.
- **C4 — the decoded-layout cache shrank from per-search to per-candidate.**
  `decode_layout_table` allocated its cache per call, and every decode builds
  a fresh `Reader` over the whole serialized e-graph, so each candidate paid
  one index per distinct layout class. `decode_layout_table` takes
  `&mut LayoutDecodeCache` again; each search copy owns one, `Finalists` owns
  one, one-shot callers pass a fresh map. Commit "The decoded-layout cache is
  the caller's again, and spans candidates".
- **C11 — a non-Base cuBLASLt marker row without the Base row was CLAIMED but
  never declared or minted**, because only the Base matcher emits snippets —
  a silent no-op that `active_allow_list()` reports as available.
  `load_with_registry` refuses that configuration by name. Commit "A non-Base
  cuBLASLt marker row without Base is refused at load"; pinned in
  `tests/registry_selection.rs`.

**Doc truth, in the source tree** (commit "Doc truth: the comments the
rejoin's five phases made false").

- **C5 — BRINGUP.md still said CL profiles candidates on the reference HOST
  executor and described a profiler seam that exists nowhere**; two later
  bullets still named `TypedBuffer` for `execute_plan`.
- **C7 / C25 — doc comments referencing symbols the move deleted:**
  `src/bufferize.rs` linked `crate::extractor::decoded_layout_table` twice
  (now `crate::layouts::decode_layout_table`), and both `RefusalBreakdown`
  docs named `search_implementations_with_runtime`, a function in neither
  copy (now each copy's own loop).
- **C12 — "an outside row without a codegen entry is never claimed; refusal
  at search" is false:** the kernel-bearing class is LABEL-keyed while codegen
  is `TypeId`-keyed and consulted at execute. Corrected in
  `ops/mod.rs`, in `load_with_registry`'s doc, and in the Phase 2 section
  above.
- **C13 — the cuBLASLt arm comments claimed C != D pointers and that D's
  prior bytes are never read**, a justification that rested on the fresh-slice
  convention Phase 3 deleted. Corrected in `device.rs` (twice) and in the
  Phase 3 kernel-invariant bullet above.
- **C14 / C16 — the `runtime.rs` module header said everything before
  `execute` is device-free and only `execute` needs the feature**; a
  `profile_on_device` search needs both. Header and `device` field doc
  amended.
- **C15 / C21 — the `CudaDevice` struct doc said the slab is never released
  between calls**; the search releases it after every profiled candidate.
- **C19 — both search headers said the CUDA-lite copy carries no tests**;
  Phase 4 gave it `early_stop_tests`.
- **C20 — CL `lib.rs` still said kernels "write fresh destinations"**; since
  Phase 3 they write recycled, unzeroed slab ranges, which is why the KERNEL
  INVARIANT exists.

**Doc truth, in this ledger** (commit "Ledger: the rejoin's own rows,
amended in place"). Each is an in-place amendment in the ledger's
"SUPERSEDED / DELIVERED — see **…**" style; no history is deleted.

- **C6 — the Phase 1 deleted-test bullet claimed "#386's semantics stay
  pinned".** Only the PREDICATE is pinned; the loop's `best_so_far` plumbing
  is unpinned and now says so. (No test-only evaluator hook: that would
  reintroduce the seam the rulings deleted.)
- **C17 — #422 INTENT (1) still said "Today CL is nowhere near" the arena
  Phase 3 landed**, and row 53 still marked the arena and registry
  INTENT-ONLY. Amended, with the #401 INTENT-for-CL paragraph as its
  companion.
- **C18 — row 33 and the #386 section still owed CL a device `PlanProfiler`
  with `StaticProfiler` as the stopgap**; both types are deleted and Phase 4
  delivered the profiler.
- **C22 — Phase 1 "Still owed" listed device profiling and the arena**, both
  delivered later in this same stack.
- **C23 — #422 INTENT (2) promised a refactor deleting `host_dispatchable`
  and the executor downcast arm**; Phase 2 punted exactly that, and
  `host_dispatchable` was never a name list.
- **C24 — the #418 / #394 "today" snapshots of the executor** (fresh alloc
  per buffer, single-shot, `TypedBuffer` outputs, the quoted CONTRACT-1
  comment) are pre-Phase-3; they carry a STATE-AS-OF note and the
  requirements below them still stand.
- **C26 — the #404 section described the pipeline and the owed spec rewrite
  in terms of `src/extractor.rs` / `src/implementation_search.rs`**, which
  Phase 1 removed from core.

**Not taken, and why.** The reviewer's alternative for C6 (a test-only
evaluator hook to re-pin the `best_so_far` plumbing) is refused: it
reintroduces the profiler seam the rulings deleted, to observe a stop that is
exact and therefore cannot change any outcome. C12's "make the statement true"
option — keying the kernel-bearing test on the prototype's DPS `TypeId` — is
recorded, not taken: it changes allow-list derivation and would need checking
against every shipped prototype. C25's optional aside (the pre-existing
LAYOUT-vs-VALUE e-class contradiction in `bufferize`'s doc paragraph, identical
at trunk) is left alone as out of this program's scope.

## Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 7 (edition 2024 for the runtime crates)

**The ruling** (Austin, 2026-09-04): *"we can flip to 2024 version, let's do
that."* Decision 24 of this program: Phase 1 found the extractor's op-cache
lookup spelled `if let Some(..) = cache.borrow().get(..) { .. } else {
..borrow_mut().. }` — correct in core's edition (2024, where the `if let`
scrutinee temporary dies before the `else` arm) and a guaranteed
`BorrowMutError` in the three copies' edition (2021, where it does not). Phase
1 split the site rather than move the crates. Phase 7 moves the crates.

**Every workspace member's edition, before and after.** The workspace
inherits `[workspace.package] edition = "2024"`, so the split was never
philosophical — it was three crates that spelled the field themselves and
were never updated.

| member | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `luminal` (root) | 2024 (`edition.workspace`) | unchanged |
| `crates/luminal_reference` | **2021** | **2024** |
| `crates/luminal_cuda_lite` | **2021** | **2024** |
| `tests/test_runtime` | **2021** | **2024** |
| `crates/luminal_nn` | 2024 | unchanged |
| `crates/luminal_tracing` | 2024 (`edition.workspace`) | unchanged |
| `examples/flux2` | 2024 | unchanged |
| `examples/{qwen3,llama3,paged_llama3,llama3_1_fp8,gemma3,qwen3_moe,gemma4_moe,whisper,yolo_v11}` | 2024 (`edition.workspace`) | unchanged |
| `tests/scalar_refs` | 2021 | **left at 2021** |
| `examples/mini/{llama3,qwen3,gemma3,qwen3_moe,gemma4_moe,whisper,conv,flux}` | 2021 | **left at 2021** |

Nine members stay at 2021 by scope, not by argument: none of them carries an
extractor copy, none was implicated in the Phase 1 bug, and flipping them is a
separate decision for Austin. Six further `Cargo.toml`s in the tree
(`crates/luminal_metal`, `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir`, `crates/luminal_bench`,
`crates/luminal_training`, `crates/luminal_python/rust`, `docs/company`) are not
workspace members at all and were not touched.

**What `cargo fix --edition` found.** Run on the OLD edition with
`--all-targets` (the migration lints only exist there), once per crate, and
once more for `luminal_cuda_lite --features device`:

| crate | machine-applicable fixes | remaining warnings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `luminal_reference` | 0 | 0 |
| `test_runtime` | 0 | 0 |
| `luminal_cuda_lite` | 1 (`rust_2024_incompatible_pat`) | 1 (`tail_expr_drop_order`) |

The one fix is `arena.rs`'s first-fit hole search: `self.holes.iter().find(|(_,
&len)| len >= need)` becomes `find(|&(_, &len)| len >= need)`. RFC 3627 forbids
a `&` sub-pattern under an inherited reference binding mode in 2024; the
explicit outer `&` restores the same binding. Nothing about `gen`, `unsafe
extern`, `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn`, RPIT lifetime capture, `!` fallback, or
`expr_2021` matchers appeared anywhere — this codebase had no 2015-era habits
left to shed.

**The one drop-order difference, analysed rather than papered over.**
`tail_expr_drop_order` fires on
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/tests/input_producer_cleanup.rs`, at the `match
rt.search(&data, &options) { .. }` that closes the body of the per-seed loop in
`sampled_genomes_never_hand_bufferize_a_cyclic_graph`. It is a tail expression,
so its scrutinee temporary — a `Result<SearchOutcome, anyhow::Error>` — is
dropped AFTER the block's locals (`cx`, `a`, `b`, `rt`, `data`, `options`) in
2021 and BEFORE them in 2024. It is inert, for a reason the lint cannot see:
both arms bind by value (`Ok(outcome)`, `Err(err)`), so the temporary is
drop-flagged moved-from by the time either edition reaches it, and its drop is
a no-op in both. Even if it were not, neither `anyhow::Error`'s destructor nor
`CudaRuntime`'s observes the other. Left exactly as written; the test is in the
gate and passes (5 passed, 7.49 s).

**The op-cache site: the split STAYS.** Under 2024 the original `if let ...
else` would now be correct here — that is the whole point of the flip, and it
is why core never hit the bug. It is not restored. The statement + `match` is
correct in BOTH editions, and these three extractors are hand-kept copies whose
correctness should not turn on the edition of whichever crate is holding them
this month. What changed is the comment: it used to end "These copies live in
2021 crates", which the flip made false. It now says the 2024 spelling would
work and why the edition-independent one is kept anyway. (There was no
dedicated test pinning the site — the split was pinned only by every search
test in the suite, all of which would panic on a regression. Those still pass.)

**What the flip cost, and it is not nothing: 55 new clippy warnings.** At
2021 all three crates were clippy-clean — measured, by reverting the edition
field and re-running: zero warnings without `--features device`, and with it
only one pre-existing `type_complexity` on `device_profile.rs`'s fixture
signature. At 2024 two lints wake up because let-chains now exist:

- `collapsible_if` x53 — `if a { if let P = b { .. } }` becomes `if a && let P
  = b { .. }`. Only spellable in 2024. Nesting and an `&&`-chain evaluate
  identically (left to right, short-circuiting), and clippy offers it only
  where NEITHER `if` has an `else`.
- `let_and_return` x2 — `let flat = if .. {..} else {..}; flat` in
  `kernels.rs`. In 2021 the lint stays quiet because removing the binding moves
  temporaries into tail position and LENGTHENS their lives; 2024's
  tail-expression scope rule removes that difference, so the lint fires and the
  rewrite is exact. Both values are `String`.

All 55 applied with `cargo clippy --fix` (once plain, once `--features
device`), then read. The three extractor copies received byte-identical hunks —
checked, because they are copies. The line-continued `bail!` strings in
`arena.rs` shift their first line left; a `\`-continued newline eats the
following indentation, so the messages are byte-identical. Device clippy is
back to its 2021 baseline exactly: the one pre-existing `type_complexity`,
which is not this phase's business.

**Formatting.** rustfmt's style edition follows the crate's Rust edition, and
there is no `rustfmt.toml` pinning a style, so the three crates reformat under
2024's rules and nothing else in the workspace moves. 72 files, 149/130 lines,
taken as-is in its own commit so the semantic diff stays reviewable: `use`
items sort case-sensitively again (`{Context, Result, anyhow, bail}`); over-long
`assert!`/`println!` arguments break after the opening paren instead of hanging
off the receiver; short `if`/`else` and match arms that fit collapse to one
line. Verified mechanical — for 71 of 72 files the token multiset is identical
before and after, and the 72nd (`r7_e2_probe.rs`) differs by one `{}` pair
replacing one `,` where a match arm gained a block.

**Gate** (full CPU gate, macOS, rustc 1.91.1). `cargo build --workspace
--all-targets` and `cargo build -p luminal_cuda_lite --all-targets --features
device`: zero warnings, zero errors. `cargo test -p luminal --lib`: 228 passed,
0 failed, 6 ignored (the six rank-≥2 pad consumers named in **#406 pad** below
— `test_pad_2d`, `test_concat`, `test_slice_pad`, `test_unfold`,
`test_cumulative`, `test_stack` — all ran and passed; total 16 s, not the
76-minute cliff). `cargo test -p luminal_reference`: 66 passed, 2 ignored (58 lib + 1
`corpus` + 7 `mini_model_smoke`). `cargo test -p luminal_cuda_lite`: 90 passed
across the lib and 18 integration binaries, plus 1 doc-test, 3 ignored.
`cargo test -p test_runtime`: 212 passed across the lib and 40 integration
binaries, 1 ignored. `cargo test -p luminal_nn`: 31 passed. Zero failures anywhere. `cargo clippy` (both feature
sets) and `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.

**Nothing semantic changed.** That is the finding, and it was not assumed: the
only two places where 2024 could have altered behaviour are the `arena.rs`
pattern (same binding, spelled explicitly) and the `input_producer_cleanup`
drop order (a moved-from temporary), and both were checked by hand before the
gate confirmed them.

**Amended 2026-09-04 (Austin: "by default lets make everything 2024, no reason to have the
divergence").** The nine members left at 2021 above — `tests/scalar_refs` and the eight
`examples/mini/*` crates — now inherit the workspace edition (`edition.workspace = true`,
the spelling `examples/llama3` already used). The workspace built clean at 2024 before any
migration lint ran (no `cargo fix --edition` change was needed), clippy reported nothing
on the nine, rustfmt's 2024 style touched seven source files, and the suites that
exercise them (`scalar_refs`, `luminal_reference` `mini_model_smoke` 7 passed,
`luminal_cuda_lite` `example_smoke` 1 passed) are green. Every workspace member is now
edition 2024. The six non-member parks keep their own `Cargo.toml`s untouched (they track
main file-level and do not build).

## Program: #420/#422 rejoin — Phase 8 (extraction and sampler back into core)

**The question, and the census that answered it** (Austin, 2026-09-03/04:
*"how much repetition would be removed by factoring out a shared core util?
similar to how bufferize is used?"*). Measured at `1bff0235` over the six files
Phase 1 created, by `diff -u` and an LCS with autojunk off:

| | raw lines | stripped |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| all six copies (3 extractor + 3 search/sampler) | 16,328 | 11,488 |
| **duplicated** (every copy beyond one canonical) | **9,567** | **7,499** |
| of which the extractor (2 extra copies x 4,130 shared) | 8,260 | 6,618 |
| of which search/sampler | 1,307 | 881 |

**The extractor was 86% of the duplication and its runtime-specific residue was
exactly zero lines.** No copy named its own kernels, layouts or buffers; the
only `crate::` reference in any of the three was inside the reference copy's
test module. Its one runtime input was already an argument of a core trait type
(`&[Box<dyn luminal::layout_ir::OpMatcher>]`), so it needed no type parameter at
all — LESS machinery than `bufferize<L: PlanLayout>`, which is generic because a
layout is an opaque runtime value core clones and transports. The three walks
had drifted, in seven phases, by ONE hunk: CUDA-lite borrows the matcher slice
(Phase 2, `0219855b`), reference and test-runtime still took an owned `Vec`.
Eleven lines, all of them API shape. Zero logic lines. Zero bug-fix drift.

**The ruling** (Austin, 2026-09-04, on the judge's recommendation: *"I will
follow your recommendation. proceed with your recommended plan"*). Take the
first two commits of shape A — move the extractor, the sampler, and the
byte-identical accounting and reporting into core as plain functions and types —
and STOP. Do not consolidate the GA loop. No trait, no type parameter, no
closure. Phase 1's own ruling had left the door open (*"Maybe if there are some
core utilities, they can belong in core"*), and the divergence the ledger said
to wait for (*"a question to ask after the runtimes diverge, not before"*) did
not happen.

**What moved.**

| Was | Is now | Lines |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `luminal_reference::extractor`, `luminal_cuda_lite::extractor`, `test_runtime::extractor` | `luminal::extraction` — CUDA-lite's borrowed-matcher body (the more general form: a `Vec` owner passes `&vec`) plus the reference copy's `render_memo_tests` and `chain_stride_tests` | 12,638 -> 4,369 |
| the sampler block, three copies (`ProducerIndex`, `choose_position`, `sample_genome{,_reporting,_with_seed}`, `flip_closes_cycle`, `mutate_genome{,_reporting,_with_seed}`, `bufferize_cycle_tripwire`) + `sampler_tests` | `luminal::search_support` | 3 -> 1 |
| `SearchProgress`, `CaptureAwareStderr`, `log_channel_enabled`, `parse_log_flag`, `display_nanos` + `progress_tests` | `luminal::search_support` | 2 -> 1 |
| `RefusalBreakdown` (+ `summary`), `SearchTimings` (+ `summary`) | `luminal::search_support` | 2 -> 1 |
| `early_stop_exceeded` + `early_stop_tests` (Phase 4 duplicated both) | `luminal::search_support` | 2 -> 1 |

`RefusalBreakdown` takes CUDA-lite's form, the superset: the reference runtime
gains a `timed_out` field it always leaves at zero and a `, timed out 0` tail on
a diagnostic string no test reads. `bufferize_cycle_tripwire` moved although it
was not on the list, because it IS a sampler invariant check — half of what
`sampler_tests` exists to pin — and the tests moved with the sampler.

**Old names still resolve.** `luminal_reference::extractor`,
`luminal_cuda_lite::extractor` and `test_runtime::extractor` are
`pub use luminal::extraction as extractor;`. `test_runtime::sampler` is
`pub use luminal::search_support as sampler;`. Both runtimes' `search` modules
re-export the moved items under their own name, so
`luminal_cuda_lite::search::early_stop_exceeded` (which `profile.rs` imports)
and `test_runtime::sampler::{ProducerIndex, sample_genome_with_seed,
mutate_genome_with_seed}` (which `tests/scc_sampler.rs` imports) are untouched.
The only call-site edits were an `&` where a runtime handed over an owned
matcher list — five in `luminal_reference::harness`, one each in its `runtime.rs`
and `search.rs`, three in `test_runtime::lib`, and seven in test files (five of
which needed a `let matchers = ...` local, because an `ExtractionSession`
borrows the list for longer than a temporary lives).

**A collateral deletion.** `test_runtime`'s `adopt_genome` / `adopt_choice` and
the ordering-closure bridge (~45 lines) existed only because CUDA-lite's
`Genome` and test-runtime's `Genome` were structurally identical but nominally
distinct types. There is one `Genome` now, so the election wrappers just
forward.

**What deliberately stays runtime-local, and why.** The GA loop is the one piece
that cannot have `bufferize`'s shape: it must PRICE a plan in the middle of
every iteration — the reference runtime builds a fresh `ReferenceRuntime`, loads
the plan, stages the caller's data and times `trials` executes; CUDA-lite reads
a heuristic or compiles, warms and times the candidate on a real device. Sharing
the loop means core calling back out mid-call, which is a closure or a trait —
the seam `1f18a04b` deleted and the 2026-09-03 ruling closed. That is ~284
duplicated lines bought with ~250 lines of glue, and it was not taken. Staying
with the loops for the same reason: `CompileOptions` and `SearchOutcome` (whose
shapes differ per runtime), the evaluators (`profile_on_reference_runtime`;
`Evaluator`/`Priced`), the bucketed drivers and `select_bucket` (the reference
needs per-bucket data, CUDA-lite one device for all buckets),
`harness_search_options`, and CUDA-lite's `finalists`/`lattice`.

The line this phase draws is not "core vs runtime" but **describes vs decides**.
A genome is drawn the same way everywhere and a graph is walked the same way
everywhere; a genome is PRICED differently everywhere. Runtime-specific now
means SELECTION: the op registry, the allow list, the evaluator, the option
knobs and outcome shape, the finalist policy, and the loop. Saturation stays
runtime-triggered; nothing here touches it.

**The numbers.** Code delta versus `rejoin/p7-edition-2024`, before this ledger
entry: 18 files changed, **1,209 insertions, 10,277 deletions — net -9,068**.
Of the 9,567 duplicated lines the census counted, essentially all are gone; what
remains is not duplication but re-export lines. File sizes:
`crates/luminal_reference/src/extractor.rs` 4,342 + `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/extractor.rs`
4,152 + `tests/test_runtime/src/extractor.rs` 4,144 -> `src/extraction.rs` 4,369;
`crates/luminal_reference/src/search.rs` 1,709 -> 774;
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/search.rs` 1,701 -> 1,147;
`tests/test_runtime/src/sampler.rs` 285 -> 0; `src/search_support.rs` 998 new.

**Where the tests went.** Nine test functions moved from
`luminal_reference::search` and its extractor copy into core, so
`cargo test -p luminal --lib` went 233 -> 242 and `cargo test -p luminal_reference
--lib` went 53 -> 44. Core's `chain_stride_tests` reaches for a registry through
the `luminal_reference` dev-dependency and spells the crossing `luminal::`, per
the dep-world rule (the cyclic dev-dependency compiles the library twice and the
two builds' types do not unify).

**Trajectory: nothing that consumes the RNG changed.** The stream is consumed
only by `choose_position`, through `sample_genome_reporting` /
`mutate_genome_reporting`, in the order each loop calls them; the index is a
`BTreeMap` and the sampling space is sorted. All of it moved verbatim and both
loops call it in the same order, so the seeded pins see the same genomes. They
were run by name and are unchanged: `cublaslt_election` (9 passed, including
`canonical_2d_matmul_elects_the_marker` and the seven per-model election rows),
`cublaslt_bias_premise` (3), `cublaslt_contracts_cpu` (19), `finalists_lattice`
(4), `dim_buckets` (5).

**The gate.** `cargo build --workspace --all-targets` clean;
`cargo check -p luminal_cuda_lite --features device --all-targets` clean;
`cargo test -p luminal --lib` 242 passed / 6 ignored (was 233 — the nine that
moved); `cargo test -p luminal_reference` 44 lib + 1 `corpus` + 7
`mini_model_smoke` passed, 2 ignored (the lib was 53); `cargo test -p
luminal_cuda_lite` 90 passed / 3 ignored across the lib, 18 integration binaries
and 1 doc-test; `cargo test -p test_runtime` 212 passed / 1 ignored across the
lib and 41 integration binaries; `cargo test -p luminal_nn` 31 passed. The
CUDA-lite, test-runtime and nn totals are IDENTICAL to Phase 7's. `cargo clippy -p luminal -p luminal_reference -p luminal_cuda_lite -p
test_runtime --all-targets` clean; with `--features device` the one warning is
`device_profile.rs`'s pre-existing `type_complexity` on a fixture signature this
phase did not touch. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean. Device-gated suites
still need the A100 box per the recipe.

**What is owed.** The aliases (`pub use luminal::extraction as extractor;` x3,
`as sampler`) keep three crates exposing a module they do not own — convenient
here, because it made the move a zero-diff change for 12 external files, but a
rename sweep is owed eventually. And the GA loop is still two copies of ~290
lines; if it is ever consolidated it needs the evaluator seam, which needs
Austin.

## #430 dyn-dims on rebuild — parked, and why the whole CUDA-graph line is park-only

Main's `e7f9127a` (+15, one file) closes a null-pointer window in
`CudaGraphOp`'s rebuild path. When a binding change forces the op to throw away
its materialized CUDA graph and build a new one,
`Self::reset_materialization_state(&mut state)` releases the graph-owned
dynamic-dimension buffer along with everything else; the replacement graph is
then built while `state.dyn_dims_buffer` is `None`, so its first binding update
tries to parameterize every dynamic kernel against a null dyn-dims pointer.
Main's fix re-allocates that buffer from `self.dyn_dims_order` and fills it from
the live `dyn_map` (missing dims read as `0`) immediately after the reset and
before `build_graph`, and it is careful to do so only when the buckets supply no
shared buffer — `state.shared_dyn_dims_ptr.is_none()` — because a bucket-shared
pointer survives the reset and must not be shadowed by a local allocation.

**Disposition: FILE-LEVEL park, path-rewritten only.** Main's diff applied
verbatim to `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/kernel/to_host.rs` under
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/` -> `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/`; no re-spelling
was needed, and the diff-of-diffs against main's hunk set (normalized for line
offsets) is identical.

**Why nothing live corresponds — stated once for all eight commits of this line
(#430, #440, #442, #450, #466, #467, #472, #487).** This branch's
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite` is not main's crate under a shared name; it is a
rewrite — the CL backend (`search.rs`, `lattice.rs`, `finalists.rs`, `arena.rs`,
`device.rs`, ~6.0k lines in all) — and it carries NO CUDA-graph machinery
whatsoever. `grep -rni 'cuda_graph\|CudaGraph\|graph_exec\|stream_capture'
crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/` returns zero hits. `execute_plan`
(`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/device.rs:254`) walks the plan's steps and
launches each kernel individually through `stream.launch_builder(&func)`
(`device.rs:596`). There is no capture, no graph exec, no replay, no cached
child graph and no bucket residency set — hence no rebuild path, no capture
cache and no eviction policy for any of these eight commits to fix. Each of
them patches machinery that exists only in main's HLIR CUDA crate, which the
park TRACKS so the target CL must eventually reach keeps moving. When CL grows
graph capture, this section and the seven below it are the list of hazards main
has already paid for; until then they are records only, and nothing here is
compiled — `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir` is not a workspace member.

## #435 persistent compiled artifacts — parked whole, parity owed (LUM-806)

Main's `188e92e8` (28 files, +1526/-132) makes a compiled graph SURVIVE THE
PROCESS: core gains `src/graph/artifact.rs` and a `SelectedSchedule` — per
dyn-dim bucket, the saturated program's identity plus the chosen genome — that
serializes beside the backend's own artifact (`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/artifact.rs`),
so a later run deserializes the schedule, rebuilds the plan and executes it
instead of re-running the genetic search; the Python side keys and reuses those
artifacts across FX regions (`artifact_cache.py`, `region_compile.py`,
`rust/src/compiled_graph/artifact.rs`, schema version 4). Seventeen of its
twenty-eight files are park files and applied cleanly — 7 path-rewritten from
main's `crates/luminal_cuda_lite/` into `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/`, 1
metal-park signature line, 9 python-park files — with two lines re-spelled to
the parks' vocabulary (`Expression` -> `IntExpr` in
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/kernel/fusion/region_codegen.rs:1446` and
three times in the new `crates/luminal_python/rust/src/compiled_graph/artifact.rs`);
the diff-of-diffs over the crates half is identical to main's hunk set modulo
exactly those two respellings. The other eleven files are main's CORE
(`src/{dtype,dyn_backend,hlir,op,graph}.rs`, `src/graph/artifact.rs`,
`src/egglog_utils/mod.rs`, `src/search/{mod,finalist,genetic,lattice}.rs`) and
no diff can apply: on this branch `hlir.rs`, `op.rs`, `dyn_backend.rs`,
`egglog_utils/` and the whole `src/search/` tree are DELETED, and `graph.rs` and
`dtype.rs` are different files (the recorder, and this branch's dtype ontology),
so per Austin's ruling the post-#435 FULL FILES are parked verbatim under
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/main_core/` at main's relative paths — a record,
documented in that crate's README, compiled by nothing and touching no live file.

**THE PARITY REQUIREMENT (Austin, 2026-09-04 — LUM-806).** This branch must
eventually ship a compiled artifact that persists the selected schedule: per
bucket, the saturated program's identity or fingerprint plus the chosen
genome/plan, such that a fresh process loads it and runs without re-running the
genetic search. Where it attaches here is already visible: the runtime-owned
search outcome is `crates/luminal_cuda_lite`'s `CudaPlan`
(`crates/luminal_cuda_lite/src/lib.rs:90`, held as `FinalistEntry::plan` in
`finalists.rs:73`), with the reference runtime's plan as its mirror, and the
selection itself is core's shared `luminal::extraction::Genome`
(`src/extraction.rs:538`) — a `HashMap<ClassId, ProducerChoice>` keyed by class
NAME, not by a positional index, so no index-determinism fix is owed for the
serialization itself. (Whether those class names reproduce across processes is
the separate, already-recorded class-id stability question, and it is the first
thing a schedule-loading implementation has to answer.)
## #437 signed integral pow — banked, and the same defect fixed in the frontend

Main's `a3c5df9f` replaces the `aten.pow.Tensor_Scalar` arm's one special case
(`exp == 2` becomes `a * a`) with `translate_tensor_scalar_pow`, which lowers
every finite whole-number scalar exponent by exponentiation by squaring —
reciprocal for negative exponents, a ones constant at zero — and falls through
to `GraphTensor::pow` only for non-integral exponents. All four files applied
3-way with no conflict and the diff-of-diffs against `a3c5df9f` is EMPTY: this
commit needed no re-spelling, because everything it reaches for
(`output_meta_dtype`, `get_float_arg`, `constant_like`,
`GraphTensor::reciprocal`) already exists here under main's name and no hunk
touches a `ShapeTracker`, a `.shape` or an `Expression`.

The reason main needed it is live in this branch too, and not only in the park:
`GraphTensor::pow` at `src/frontend/binary.rs:395` was the identical
sign-dropping approximation, `self.abs().log().mul(e).exp()`, so `(-2)^3`
answered `+8` for every caller and GPT-2's approximate GELU — whose cubic term
is `x.pow(3)` — was corrupted on every negative input. Austin ruled 2026-09-04
*"fix the front end"*, and that fix is **PR #491**: a `PowExponent` trait whose
`f32` impl lowers finite whole-number exponents structurally (capped at
`|e| <= 64`) while tensor exponents and non-whole scalars keep the
approximation. With #491 landed the park's own workaround becomes redundant
rather than wrong — the M4 translator re-attachment can drop
`translate_tensor_scalar_pow` and call `pow` directly, and that is the
follow-up this row owes.

Nothing was rebuilt or rerun for the park: `crates/luminal_python` is not a
workspace member here, so main's pytest verification (the parametrised
`test_pow_by_integral_scalar_preserves_sign`, the integer-base dtype promotion
check, and the GPT-2 GELU regression) remains main's, measured against main's
HLIR backend.

## #440 capture cache capacity — parked

Main's `2b368a29` (+12/-4, one file) turns the hard-coded cuBLASLt child-graph
capture cache size into a knob: `CUBLASLT_CAPTURE_CACHE_CAPACITY: usize = 2`
becomes `DEFAULT_CUBLASLT_CAPTURE_CACHE_CAPACITY` plus a
`cublaslt_capture_cache_capacity()` reader over
`LUMINAL_CUBLASLT_CAPTURE_CACHE_CAPACITY`, parsed and filtered to a positive
value with the default as fallback. All three uses move to the function — the
`persistent_device_bytes().checked_mul(...)` resource accounting so the planner
prices whatever capacity is actually configured, and the two eviction checks,
which also relax `==` to `>=` so a capacity lowered at runtime below a cache
that has already grown still evicts instead of silently retaining forever.
**Disposition: FILE-LEVEL park, path-rewritten only** — applied verbatim to
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/kernel/to_host.rs` (const at `:123`, the
reader at `:125`, the multiply at `:1337`, the eviction checks at `:3472` and
`:3890`); diff-of-diffs identical.
## #441 inference batch norm — banked; the dead-reduction argument recorded

Main's `e8780fc8` routes
`torch.ops.aten._native_batch_norm_legit_no_training.default` into
`translate_batch_norm_functional` and makes that function honest about what
inference needs: `training` is forced false for the new overload, the
`training || functional` guard admits it, and `batch_mean` / `batch_var` become
`Option`s computed only on the training path, with every later use taking them
through `.context(..)`. The three files applied 3-way with one conflict, in
`pooling.rs`, on park drift alone — main's `compute.shape` is `compute.dims()`
here — resolved to main's content in the park's spelling; the diff-of-diffs
against `e8780fc8` is then EMPTY modulo exactly that substitution. (`#414`'s
other known respelling in this function, `input.shape.len()` ->
`input.legacy_tracker_ref().len()`, sat in the hunk's context and needed no
hand work.)

The reason worth keeping is main's own comment, and it is a compiler argument
rather than a lowering one: an eval-mode BatchNorm that still computes a batch
mean and variance is not merely doing dead work, it *enlarges the search
space*, because those reductions are real nodes the extractor has to cost
before discovering nothing consumes them. That is a REQUIREMENT on the M4
translator re-attachment — refuse to record the reductions, do not rely on
downstream elimination — and it generalises past batch norm to every
training/inference-forked lowering. Nothing was rebuilt or rerun:
`crates/luminal_python` is not a workspace member here, so main's pytest
(`test_inference_batch_norm_uses_running_stats_and_returns_empty_saved_stats`,
affine and non-affine) remains main's.

## #442 evict before recapture — parked

Main's `cb8d270d` (+15/-6, one file) moves the cuBLASLt capture-cache eviction
from AFTER the new child graph is captured and pushed to BEFORE the capture
starts, at both call sites (the recapture path and the fresh-prepare path).
Evicting afterwards transiently holds `capacity + 1` CUDA graphs alive, which
can OOM on device even when the steady state fits the ceiling the planner
accounted for at #440 — the accounting prices `capacity`, so the peak must never
exceed it. The fresh-prepare site needs a small scoped borrow
(`{ let op = &mut state.cublaslt_ops[idx]; ... }`) to make room before
`capture_cublaslt_child_graph` is called. **Disposition: FILE-LEVEL park,
path-rewritten only** — applied verbatim, no re-expression was needed because
the park had just taken #440 verbatim and so carried main's exact preimage,
evict-after-push at both sites included; diff-of-diffs identical.

## #450 bucket residency — parked

Main's `fb6bf0a4` (+128, one file) caps how many compiled buckets may hold
materialized CUDA graph executables at once. A serving model whose kernels and
shared arena fit comfortably can still accumulate ruinous CUDA DRIVER graph
memory across many scheduler shapes, so `CudaRuntimeImpl` gains
`max_materialized_buckets: Option<usize>` (`None` = today's unbounded default,
`Some(0)` asserted invalid because the active bucket must stay usable) plus a
`materialized_bucket_lru: VecDeque<usize>`, the setter/builder pair
`set_max_materialized_buckets` / `with_max_materialized_buckets`, and
`prepare_materialized_bucket_slot`, which is called BEFORE the active bucket
materializes so peak driver memory never holds the old resident set and its
replacement together. The eviction choice itself is factored into a pure
function, `materialized_bucket_evictions(materialized, lru, keep, capacity)` —
projected residency minus capacity, walking the LRU and then the bucket order,
never evicting `keep` — and that is what the commit's one unit test pins; the
eviction path synchronizes the stream on both sides of
`release_bucket_cuda_graphs` and then trims driver graph memory. Only driver
graph state is released: compiled kernels and the shared arena stay resident and
the bucket rebuilds its graphs if it is needed again. **Disposition: FILE-LEVEL
park, path-rewritten only** — applied verbatim to
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/runtime.rs`; diff-of-diffs identical.

## #453 qwen3_moe TTFT — ignored by ruling, not synced

Main's `dd3d6633` is one line: `ci/example_output.py`'s `PERF_GATES` raises
`qwen3_moe`'s `max_ttft_ms` from 450.0 to 1000.0 (the companion `max_tpot_ms`
bump to 50.0 was already synced here by an earlier walk, so 450.0/50.0 is what
this branch's line 27 reads today). RULED 2026-09-04: *"just ignore the number
in CI for now, we're eventually going to move these tests out of CI/CD into
their own system"* — so nothing is applied and the branch keeps 450.0, which
narrows the earlier sync-main's-numbers decision (ruling 1 of 2026-09-02) to
exclude this line. Nothing is at risk either way: this branch has never
re-baselined `qwen3_moe` against its own CL runtime, so the figure gates nothing
here and is a main-side A100 draw about main's HLIR CUDA backend, not ours.

## #466 capture-failure diagnostics — parked

Main's `e891a57e` (+11/-1, one file) is a diagnostics-only change: when
`materialize_bucket_cuda_graphs` fails, the panic no longer says only *"CUDA
graph materialization failed: {e}"* but also names the active bucket, the
configured `max_materialized_buckets` limit, the current
`materialized_bucket_lru`, and the device's live `mem_get_info()` free/total.
The point is that the failures worth debugging here are OOMs caused by
residency policy, and the residency state (#450) is exactly what the old
message omitted. **Disposition: FILE-LEVEL park, path-rewritten only** —
applied verbatim to `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/runtime.rs`;
diff-of-diffs identical.

## #467 reclaim before replacement — parked

Main's `fbe47db7` (+40/-2, two files) applies #442's principle — never hold the
old thing and its replacement at once — to CUDA graph EXECUTABLES and to the two
independent driver pools. `CudaGraphOp::retire_failed_graph_exec` synchronizes,
drops the executable that just rejected an `update_from_graph`, binds the
context and calls `cuDeviceGraphMemTrim` BEFORE the replacement is instantiated,
because CUDA can retain a model-sized graph allocation until both the executable
is destroyed and the graph pool is trimmed; it is wired into both
re-instantiation sites (the cuBLASLt post-recapture update and the generic
`old_exec` update path, which previously just fell through to
`graph.instantiate()?`). In `runtime.rs`, bucket eviction additionally calls
`trim_current_memory_pool` before `trim_device_graph_memory`, since releasing a
bucket also drops prepared library workspaces and internal buffers from the
STREAM-ORDERED pool, whose retained pages the graph allocator cannot reuse — two
pools, both trimmed. Note the dependency: this builds on #450's
`prepare_materialized_bucket_slot`, not on #466. **Disposition: FILE-LEVEL park,
path-rewritten only** — applied verbatim to
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/kernel/to_host.rs` and `.../src/runtime.rs`;
diff-of-diffs identical.

## #472 trim after recapture — parked

Main's `9614ddef` (+28/-6, one file) generalizes #467's one-shot reclaim into a
reusable `CudaGraphOp::trim_recapture_memory(stream)`: synchronize, bind the
context, and — when the device supports async allocation
(`context.has_async_alloc()`) — `mem_pool::trim_to(pool, 0)` on the device's
stream-ordered pool, then `cuDeviceGraphMemTrim` on the separate device graph
pool. Both pools matter because prepared library state comes from the
stream-ordered pool while graph executable updates come from the graph pool, and
a shape-changing serving workload otherwise leaves EACH GENERATION cached in a
different pool until the device is exhausted. `retire_failed_graph_exec` is
rewritten to call it, and it is additionally called at the end of the successful
recapture path — replacing captured library plans releases their prior device
buffers only once the executable points at the new graph, so the reclaim has to
happen after that, before the next shape change prepares another complete
generation. **Disposition: FILE-LEVEL park, path-rewritten only** — applied
verbatim to `crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/kernel/to_host.rs`; diff-of-diffs
identical.

## #487 reclaim on full rebuild — parked

Main's `d9682b80` (+37/-19, one file) closes the last leak in this line: #472's
trim covered the SURGICAL recapture path, but a FULL rebuild — where the whole
materialization is thrown away — did not reclaim anything.
`reset_materialization_state_and_trim` pairs the reset with
`trim_recapture_memory`, and all three full-rebuild sites now use it: captured
HostOp shape change, captured HostOp pointer rebuild, and the internal-buffer
realloc path, which is restructured so the retire happens BEFORE the new
internal buffers are allocated rather than as a scattered
`cuda_graph = None; cuda_graph_exec = None; graph_node = None; kernel_params.clear()`
block afterwards. `trim_recapture_memory` and `retire_failed_graph_exec` also
become `&self` methods so the former can synchronize the PRIVATE capture stream
(`self.capture_stream.borrow()`) before trimming — after end-capture returns
CUDA may still hold stream-ordered allocations for the retired capture until
that stream reaches a synchronization boundary. **Disposition: FILE-LEVEL park,
path-rewritten only** — applied verbatim to
`crates/luminal_cuda_lite_hlir/src/kernel/to_host.rs`; diff-of-diffs identical.
Note that this rewrites the very hunk #430 added, and the park took both in
order, so the park's `to_host.rs` now matches main's post-#487 file exactly at
these sites.

## #406 pad — the select construction REVERTED (2026-09-03)

Ruling 4b's "option i" (`select_by_index`: packed 2N iota + two `scatter1d` +
`gather1d`, landed in PR #471 / `0e6e7868`) was measured and reverted the same
day. The core lib test suite went from ~15 s to >76 minutes (killed); a
`sample` of the live binary put every surviving thread — the rank-≥2 pad
consumers `test_pad_2d`, `test_concat`, `test_slice_pad`, `test_unfold`,
`test_cumulative`, `test_stack` — inside `egglog::EGraph::run_schedule` with
the time in `luminal::subst_primitive::{substitute, Walk::collect, Walk::build}`.
The study (opus agent, worktree pad-study, AFTER state): rank-1 pad saturates
in 72 ms (670 classes / 1238 e-nodes vs 177 / 321 for a bare multiply; 7
applies instead of 1; winning plan 18 buffers instead of 4); a rank-2 pad of
`(4,8)` by one cell per axis does not finish saturation in 15 minutes. Padding
width and tensor size are irrelevant; RANK is everything. Mechanism: each
`scatter1d`/`gather1d` flattens and `unflatten_to`s, minting
`LogicalIndexMapApply` chains whose entries are `IntTruncDiv`/`IntTruncRem`
(6 at rank 1, 23 at rank 2, nested at rank 2); native affine composition has
no arm for div/rem entries (`egglog_preamble.egg` ~4066-4079), so every link
falls through to the `:naive` subst-walk rule (~4007-4015) whose `Walk::collect`
copies the whole reachable region per generation and re-mints a
`LayoutTensorLit` per parent layout per apply. The gather coordinate
`even + index` is an add of two iotas that no rule folds back into an iota,
so `gather/unification_4.egg` (all-iota coordinates ≡ view) can never fire —
pad's read cannot fold back into the views-stage seam. The rank-1 tests the
commit pinned could not see any of this.

**What this revert does.** `pad` and `pad_with` return to the clamped-view ×
mask arithmetic; `pad(padding, 0.0)` records NO fill term (the graph is the
pre-#406 one in the common case); `pad_with` keeps the typed scalar fill
through `masked + (1 - mask) * fill` with the `1` minted as an Int constant
cast to the input dtype. `select_by_index` is deleted. The NaN test
`pad_fill_is_exact_beside_non_finite_values` is deleted because the leak is
back: `0 * NaN` / `0 * Inf` poisons the padding. The typed-fill test is F32:
an Int tensor pads through the same arithmetic but Int add/mul are
proof-gated and refuse without a `bind_value_range` attestation. `ne → Bool`
and `constant_i64` from the same commit are untouched.

**Tickets.** LUM-805 (Bug) records this blowup, the measurements and the full
analysis; LUM-804 still owns the fix — a native `Bool8` select op, never a
gather construction. Any future pad construction is gated by the rank-≥2
pad-family proptests actually finishing, not by named rank-1 tests.

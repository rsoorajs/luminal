# Contributor Guide

## Structure
Luminal is a core-and-plugin design, where the core crate `.` contains everything core to Luminal including the graph and the GraphTensor api, the shapetracker, and the primitive ops.

All other functionality is split into crates in the `crates/` directory. For instance, the Cuda compiler is in `luminal_cuda_lite` and the autograd engine is in `luminal_training`. `luminal_nn` has common nn modules.

## Testing Instructions
- Find the CI plan in the .github/workflows folder.
- Currently running `cargo test` in luminal_metal and luminal_cuda_lite require access to an Apple and Nvidia GPU respectively.
- PRs must have no clippy errors and `cargo fmt` must be ran before a PR is submitted.

### Run only the tests you need (tiers)
`cargo test --workspace` is a LANDING gate, not an iteration gate. Reaching for it
mid-change is the single biggest waste in this repo — measured: one zoo decode
loop is 185s, `luminal_nn`'s `decoder_block_matches_scalar_reference` is 98s and
`llama_block_forward_rope...` is 47s, while genuine unit tests are 1-2s each.

- **Spin** (working in core / the bufferizer / rewrites): `cargo test -p luminal --lib`.
  Nothing else. This is the loop you should be in almost all the time.
- **Spin + proof of life** (the core change must still drive a runtime): add ONE
  targeted runtime test, e.g. `cargo test -p luminal_reference --lib <filter>` or a
  single named `-p luminal_cuda_lite --test <file>`. Enough to prove the seam,
  not the corpus.
- **Landing** (about to commit, or the change is done): the full sweep —
  `cargo test -p luminal`, `-p luminal_reference`, `-p luminal_cuda_lite`,
  `-p test_runtime`, `-p luminal_nn`, plus device suites where a GPU is available.

The mini model families provide execution-only smoke coverage in the runtime
crates; for example, `cargo test --release -p luminal_reference --test
mini_model_smoke`. Numerical and cross-runtime correctness belongs in the
operation/runtime suites rather than model examples. A smoke test is ignored
only for a documented blocker; `mini_flux_runs` records the current adaLN
rejoin-divergence search issue in its reason string.

## Debugging and Correctness
- Treat model examples as specifications of the intended architecture. Do not change model code, prompt templates, weights, or example logic to hide compiler/runtime/search bugs unless the model code is demonstrably semantically wrong.
- When outputs are incorrect, first root-cause the failing compiler/runtime path. Prefer isolating the bad LLIR/HLIR graph, rewrite, op lowering, shape/stride assumption, layout contract, or runtime implementation that caused the mismatch.
- Avoid narrow special-case fixes. A fix should state and enforce the general invariant it relies on, or explicitly document why the affected operation is only valid for a restricted layout/shape and ensure rewrites enforce that restriction.
- For e-graph/search issues, assume all selectable LLIR graphs are intended to be semantically equivalent. If two selectable graphs disagree, debug the equivalence violation rather than selecting around the bad graph.
- Add regression tests at the level where the bug occurred. Prefer tests that compare against a semantic reference such as `ReferenceRuntime` or a small independent reference, and use fixed seeds for any randomized search/fuzz test so failures are reproducible.

## Compiler Rewrite Boundary
- All graph pattern matching and op selection must be expressed in egglog rewrites. Do not add Rust-side LLIR graph post-passes that search for op patterns, fuse kernels, select backend ops, or otherwise rewrite extracted graphs after egglog. If a backend needs a fused/specialized op, add the match and rewrite in egglog and let extraction produce that op directly.

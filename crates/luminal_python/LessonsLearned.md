## 2026-02-24 — Intermittent CUDA Backend Failures: Embed False Match + Batched Matmul Dimension Drop

### Background: Why the Failures Were Intermittent

Both bugs only appeared on roughly 50% of test runs. The source of non-determinism is
`FxHashMap` (a fixed-seed hash map). The egglog optimizer's `SerializedEGraph::new` builds
`Vec<NodeId>` orderings for each e-class by iterating a `FxHashMap`, producing non-deterministic
node orderings. `random_initial_choice()` in `src/egglog_utils/mod.rs` then randomly picks one
e-node per e-class as the starting representation for the profiling phase. The combination means
some runs pick a correct kernel and some pick a broken one from the same e-class.

**Lesson**: When a test fails intermittently at a roughly 50% rate, suspect the egglog extractor
choosing between two e-nodes in the same e-class — one correct, one broken. The fix is always in
the broken e-node's rewrite rule.

### Bug 1: `test_gather_elements` — KernelEmbed and RowEmbed False Match

**Files changed**:
- `crates/luminal_cuda/src/kernel/hlir.rs` (KernelEmbed, 4 rules)
- `crates/luminal_cuda/src/block/ops.rs` (RowEmbed, 4 rules)

#### What happened

`gather_elements` (axis-aware gather) decomposes into a flat gather by computing:

```
flat_idx = Add(
    Mul(indices, stride[axis]),
    Mul(Expand(Iota(dim_size)), stride[non_axis])
)
```

`KernelEmbed` and `RowEmbed` are optimized embedding lookup kernels. A genuine embedding
lookup produces:

```
flat_idx = Add(
    Mul(Cast(token_ids), embed_dim),
    Iota(embed_dim)              ← bare Iota, the position within an embedding row
)
```

The egglog rewrite rules for both ops matched `Add(?mul_result, ?iota_result)` where
`?iota_result` was **unconstrained** — it could bind to anything, including
`Mul(Expand(Iota(n)), stride)` from `gather_elements`. This created a `KernelEmbed`/`RowEmbed`
node in the same e-class as the `Gather` node. When the extractor picked it, `build_payload`
called `flatten_mul_strides(range, token_stride)` which asserted `range.len() == token_stride.len()`:
- `range` came from `RemoveNthFromEnd(idx_shape, 0)` → length 1
- `token_stride` came from the indices strides → length 2
- Assertion failed → panic.

#### The fix

Add `(= ?iota_result (Iota ?iota_expr ?iota_range))` to all 8 rules, requiring the positional
component to be a bare `Iota` node:

```egglog
(= ?indices (Add ?add_shape ?mul_result ?mul_stride ?iota_result ?iota_stride ?add_out_stride))
(= ?iota_result (Iota ?iota_expr ?iota_range))   ← added
(= ?mul_result (Mul ...))
```

#### Investigation note

The initial plan correctly identified `KernelEmbed` as faulty, but missed `RowEmbed`. The two
ops are structurally identical but live in different parts of the codebase (`kernel/` vs
`block/`). The second bug was only discovered when the backtrace pointed to
`RowEmbed::build_payload` instead of `KernelEmbed::compile`. Always search for sibling
implementations when fixing a pattern-matching bug in one op.

### Bug 2: `test_matmul_batched` — CuBlasLt Drops Batch Dimension

**Files changed**:
- `crates/luminal_cuda/src/host/cublaslt/cublaslt_RmRm_rewrite.egg`
- `crates/luminal_cuda/src/host/cublaslt/cublaslt_RmCm_rewrite.egg`
- `crates/luminal_cuda/src/host/cublaslt/cublaslt_CmRm_rewrite.egg`
- `crates/luminal_cuda/src/host/cublaslt/cublaslt_CmCm_rewrite.egg`

#### What happened

The luminal frontend decomposes `(2,3,4) @ (2,4,5)` into:

```rust
let w = rhs.permute((0, 2, 1));       // (2,4,5) → (2,5,4)
let mul = self.expand_dim(2, d)        // (2,3,4) → (2,3,5,4)
        * w.expand_dim(1, b);          // (2,5,4) → (2,3,5,4)
mul.sum(3)                             // → (2,3,5), correct out_shape
```

All four cublaslt rewrite rules extracted `m` and `n` from the output shape using
`nth_from_end`, which succeeds for any rank:

```egglog
(= ?m (nth_from_end ?out_shape 1))
(= ?n (nth_from_end ?out_shape 0))
```

For `out_shape = [2, 3, 5]`: `?m = 3`, `?n = 5`. The batch dim `2` is never extracted or
stored. The rules also validated stride patterns using `nth_from_end` on the stride arrays —
but for this batched case, **all stride checks coincidentally passed** because the last three
strides of the 4D expanded tensors happened to satisfy the 2D row/column-major patterns.

The resulting `CuBlasLt` node had `output_size() = m * n = 15`. The batch dimension was
silently discarded. The runtime allocated a 15-element output buffer, cuBLAS wrote a 3×5
result, and the test got back 15 values instead of 30.

#### The fix

Add `(= (len ?out_shape) 2)` to all 4 rules:

```egglog
(= (len ?out_shape) 2)    ← added: cuBLAS is 2D only
(= ?m (nth_from_end ?out_shape 1))
(= ?n (nth_from_end ?out_shape 0))
```

`len` counts elements in the `ECons`-list shape. With this constraint, any `Sum` node with a
3D+ output shape (batched matmul) is not matched by cuBLAS rules and falls through to
`KernelSumReduce + KernelMul` (or the tiling block ops), which correctly use
`out_shape.iter().product()` for their output sizes.

Note: `TileMatmulSplitK` and `TileMatmulFullSplit` do NOT need this fix — their `output_size()`
already returns `untiled_range.iter().product()` which includes all dimensions.

---

### General Principle: Always Constrain Shape Rank in Egglog Rules

Both bugs share the same structural cause: **egglog rewrite rules that used `nth_from_end` to
extract dimensions from a shape list without constraining the list's length.** Since
`nth_from_end` silently succeeds for any list with enough trailing elements, rules written for
2D tensors accidentally matched higher-rank tensors.

**Rule for writing egglog rewrite rules in this codebase**:

> If a rule is designed for a specific tensor rank, always add an explicit
> `(= (len ?shape) N)` constraint. If a rule is designed to handle arbitrary ranks but an
> op's output only covers a subset of dimensions (like cuBLAS covering only the last 2),
> that is a correctness bug — either implement strided batched cuBLAS or add the rank
> constraint and fall back to a kernel that handles all dimensions.

---

### Debugging Intermittent CUDA Failures: Effective Approach

The investigation used extensive `eprintln!` debug logging to trace which kernels were compiled
vs. skipped. Key observations:

1. **In the passing case**: `KernelSumReduce::compile()` was called, kernels were allocated.
2. **In the failing case**: `KernelSumReduce::compile()` was never called, yet output was produced.

This asymmetry pointed to a `HostOp` path (cuBLAS) executing instead of the `KernelOp` path,
which narrowed the search to cublaslt rewrite rules. The HLIR-level `SumReduce::to_egglog` log
confirmed the correct HLIR node existed — the bug was in the e-graph optimization choosing
a different (broken) e-node from the same e-class.

**Effective debug strategy for egglog non-determinism bugs**:
1. Add logging at compile time for each kernel type (`KernelFoo::compile`, `HostFoo::execute`)
2. Compare passing vs. failing runs to see which kernels are/aren't invoked
3. The missing kernel's e-class contains a broken alternative — find it via the egglog rewrite rules
4. Check the op that *is* executing — its `output_size()` reveals what's wrong with the false match

## 2026-02-25 — OneHot Test Panic: Cast(Int→F32) Produces Int Output

### What the symptom was

`test_onehot` panicked at `src/hlir.rs:1625` in `get_f32()`: the output buffer was
`NativeData::Int` instead of the expected `NativeData::F32`.

### What the actual root cause was

The Cast parser's `* 1.0` workaround for `Int → F32` casts used `input * one_expanded`
(Int GraphTensor on the left, F32 constant on the right). However, `Mul for GraphTensor`
always uses `self.dtype` (the **left** operand's dtype) for the result, and the native
runtime's `Mul::execute` dispatches on the **first** input's `NativeData` variant. So
`Int * F32` produced `DType::Int` / `NativeData::Int` — the exact opposite of the intended
F32 output.

### Why it was hard to find

1. **The OneHot parser was a red herring**: The initial plan assumed the OneHot ONNX node
   was being parsed, but `torch.onnx.export` decomposes `one_hot` into
   `Unsqueeze → Equal → Cast(Bool→Int) → Cast(Int→F32)`. The OneHot parser was never called.
2. **The `* 1.0` workaround looked correct**: It was used successfully in many other parsers,
   but those all had F32 inputs (where `F32 * F32 = F32`). The Int→F32 case was the only
   path where the left operand was Int.
3. **Operand order matters silently**: Nothing warns about mixed-dtype Mul — it just takes
   the left operand's dtype.

### The fix

In `ops_parse/unary.rs` `parse_cast_node`, split the combined condition into two cases:
- **No-op cast** (`cast_result.id == input.id`): `input * one_expanded` — preserves dtype
- **Int source** (`input.dtype == DType::Int`): `one_expanded * input` — F32 on the left
  ensures F32 output

### General principle

**In luminal, binary op dtype is always the LEFT operand's dtype.** When constructing
`GraphTensor * constant_float(1.0)` for type materialization, always put the operand
whose dtype you want to preserve on the LEFT side. When converting Int→F32, the F32
constant must be the left operand.

## 2026-02-26 — ScatterND Fails on CUDA: "does not produce an egraph"

### What the symptom was

`test_scatter_nd` passed on native backend but failed on CUDA with "does not produce an
egraph". The CUDA compilation could not extract a valid program from the e-graph.

### What the actual root cause was

`scatter_nd` in `movement.rs` does `indices * 1` (line 353) to materialize the tensor for
reshaping. The `* 1` dispatches to `Mul<S: Into<Expression>>`, which creates a `constant(1)`
→ `Iota(1,1)` → `DType::Int`. But the ONNX parser creates all tensors as `DType::F32`
(via `named_tensor()` in `compiled_graph.rs:70`), so indices arrive as F32. This produces
`Mul(F32, Int)` — mixed dtypes.

The HLIR Mul dtype rule (`hlir.rs:886-888`) uses `(= ?dty (dtype ?lhs))` and
`(= ?dty (dtype ?rhs))` with the same `?dty` variable, requiring both inputs to have
matching dtypes. `F32 != Int` → the rule never fires → the Mul node gets **no dtype**.

Every downstream op checks `(= ?dty (dtype ?upstream))`. Without dtype on the Mul, no
CUDA kernel rewrite rules fire for any downstream op (KernelMul, KernelAdd, KernelLessThan,
etc.). When `cleanup_hlir` runs (enabled for CUDA, disabled for native), it deletes all
unrewritten HLIR ops, leaving empty e-classes → egraph extraction fails.

### Why it was hard to find

1. **Works on native**: `cleanup_hlir = false` for NativeRuntime, so unrewritten HLIR ops
   are never deleted. NativeOp dispatches on actual runtime data, not egglog dtype.
2. **Cascading failure**: The root cause (missing dtype on one Mul) silently propagated
   through every downstream op, making it look like a systemic CUDA issue rather than a
   single dtype mismatch.
3. **`scatter_elements` works fine**: The sibling op already cast indices via
   `(idx_f32 + (is_neg * adj)).cast(DType::Int)`, so only `scatter_nd` had this bug.

### The fix

Added `let indices = indices.cast(DType::Int);` at the top of `scatter_nd` in
`movement.rs`, before any arithmetic on indices. `GraphTensor::cast()` short-circuits
when `self.dtype == dtype`, so this is safe for callers already passing Int indices.
Also added the same cast in `parse_scatter_nd_node` for explicitness.

### General principle

**Always cast index tensors to `DType::Int` before arithmetic in graph-building code.**
ONNX tensors arrive as F32 from the Python bridge. Any `indices * stride` or
`indices * 1` will produce `Mul(F32, Int)` which breaks HLIR dtype propagation on CUDA.
The pattern `let indices = indices.cast(DType::Int);` at the top of any index-consuming
function is defensive and free (no-op when already Int).

## 2026-03-04 — Dynamic Shapes: Empty Buffer for BOOL Scalar Initializer

### What the symptom was

`test_hf_llama_decode_loop_dynamic` panicked at `bin_fn: a index 0 out of bounds (a.len=0), shape=[1, 1, 4, 4], strides=[0, 0, 0, 0]`. An Input node labeled `"new_ones"` had an empty buffer at runtime.

### What the actual root cause was

Two issues combined:

1. **`load_tensor_floats` didn't handle ONNX data_type=9 (BOOL)**. The `new_ones` initializer was a BOOL scalar (1 byte in `raw_data`). `load_tensor_floats` fell through to the fallback case, which tried `chunks_exact(4)` on 1 byte → produced 0 chunks → returned empty vec `[]`. The buffer was set with empty data.

2. **Scalar initializers with empty `dims` created 0-dimensional tensors**. ONNX represents scalars with `dims=[]`. The initializer loop computed `shape = init.dims.iter().map(|&d| d as usize).collect()` → empty vec `[]`, then called `named_tensor(name, [])` which created a tensor with 0 dimensions instead of the intended scalar `[1]`.

### Why it was hard to find

1. **Misdiagnosed as ConstantOfShape issue**: The original plan targeted `ConstantOfShape` with dynamic shapes. The shape `[1,1,4,4]` with strides `[0,0,0,0]` looked like a broadcast from a constant fill. But `parse_constant_of_shape` was never called — the `new_ones` tensor came from an ONNX initializer, not a computation node.

2. **The BOOL data type is unusual**: Most ONNX tensors are FLOAT, INT32, or INT64. BOOL initializers only appear in specific patterns (like `torch.ones()` in attention mask computation). `load_initializer_as_f32` already handled BOOL, but its sibling `load_tensor_floats` didn't.

3. **Empty vec is valid data**: `set_data(node_id, [])` doesn't panic — it silently sets an empty buffer. The error only manifests later when a downstream op tries to read index 0.

### The fix

1. Added `data_type=9` (BOOL) handling to `load_tensor_floats` in `util.rs` — same logic as `load_initializer_as_f32`: 1 byte per element, non-zero → 1.0, zero → 0.0.

2. In `compiled_graph.rs`, initializer tensor creation: if `shape.is_empty()`, set `shape = vec![1]` (scalar representation in luminal).

### General principle

**Keep data loading functions in sync.** `load_tensor_floats` and `load_initializer_as_f32` serve the same purpose (loading ONNX TensorProto data as f32) but had different data type coverage. When adding a new data type to one, check and update the other. Better yet, refactor them into a single function.

**ONNX scalars have `dims=[]`, luminal scalars have shape `[1]`.** Always convert empty dims to `[1]` when creating luminal tensors from ONNX data.

## 2026-03-04 — Where Node Missing Broadcast: KernelMul flatten_strides Panic on CUDA

### What the symptom was

`test_hf_llama3_1b_decode_loop_dynamic` panicked at `flatten_strides` with `left: 4, right: 1` during
CUDA `KernelMul::compile`. The `KernelMul` had `out_shape=[1, 1, a, a]` but `b_stride=[z]` (1D).

### What the actual root cause was

`parse_where_node` called `x.cond(condition, y)` without broadcasting the inputs to matching ranks.
The ONNX Where op for the attention mask had condition=[1,1,a,a] (4D), x=[1] (scalar), y=[1] (scalar).
Luminal's `cond` doesn't auto-broadcast — it passes the shape trackers directly to the HLIR node.
The resulting Mul had input A with 4D strides and input B with 1D strides.

### Why it was hard to find

1. **Only triggered by 1B model**: The tiny model's Where inputs all had matching ranks (no scalars).
2. **CUDA-only**: The native runtime's `bin_fn` uses `StridedIterator` which handles mismatched
   strides more gracefully. CUDA's `KernelMul::compile` calls `flatten_strides` which asserts
   `range.len() == strides.len()`.
3. **Delayed crash**: The mismatch was created during ONNX parsing but only manifested during
   CUDA kernel compilation (graph search phase).

### The fix

Added numpy-style broadcasting to `parse_where_node`: compute the broadcast shape across all 3
inputs, then `broadcast_to_expr` each to the common shape before calling `cond`.

### General principle

**ONNX binary/ternary ops all use numpy broadcasting.** When parsing ONNX ops that take multiple
tensor inputs (Where, Add, Mul, etc.), always broadcast all inputs to a common shape BEFORE
calling the luminal graph operation. Luminal graph ops do NOT auto-broadcast — they expect inputs
with matching shape tracker dimensions.

---

## Bug: TopK values wrong on CUDA (gather_elements with sliced non-contiguous indices)

1. **Symptom**: `test_topk_values` failed on CUDA — rows 0-1 were correct but rows 2+ returned
   the value at column 0 of each row (all three top-k positions got the same value).
   Native backend was fine.

2. **Root cause**: `gather_elements` was called with a non-contiguous index tensor produced by
   `argsort(axis=1) → slice_along(..k, axis=1)`. The slice creates a ShapeTracker view of the
   [4,8] argsort buffer with dims [4,3] and strides [8,1]. When this flowed through the
   gather_elements Int arithmetic chain (cast, multiply, add) and into the final Gather CUDA
   kernel, the non-contiguous strides caused incorrect index reads for later rows.

3. **Why it was hard to find**: `test_topk_indices` passed (it only tests argsort+slice, not
   the downstream gather_elements). A standalone `test_gather_elements` with constant indices
   also passed because constant indices are contiguous. The bug only manifested when runtime-
   computed non-contiguous indices were used with data of a different size along the gather axis.

4. **Fix**: In `parse_topk_node`, compute `gather_elements(x, full_argsort, axis)` with the
   full [4,8] argsort result (same size as data), then slice the gathered values to [4,3].
   This ensures gather_elements always operates on same-sized contiguous tensors.

5. **General principle**: When building graph operations that chain shape-tracker views
   (slice, transpose, etc.) into downstream HLIR ops on CUDA, prefer operating on full
   contiguous tensors first and slicing the result afterward. Non-contiguous views flowing
   through multiple CUDA kernels can trigger stride-related bugs in the egglog-compiled code.

## 2026-03-07 — Non-deterministic CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS: Multiple Missing Rank Constraints

### What the symptom was

`test_hf_llama_tiny` on CUDA failed ~70% of runs with `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS`. Failures
were non-deterministic due to egglog's `FxHashMap` iteration order in `random_initial_choice()`.

### What the actual root cause was

**Multiple** matmul egglog rules lacked `(= (len ?out_shape) 2)` constraints:

1. `TileMatmulSplitK` in `block/ops.rs` (disabled via comment but rule still registered)
2. `TileMatmulFullSplit` in `block/ops.rs`
3. All 4 `sgemm_v2_*.egg` rules in `host/cublas/`

The `cublaslt_*.egg` rules already had the constraint. When egglog picked TileMatmul or sgemm
for a 3D+ batched matmul, the generated CUDA kernels accessed out-of-bounds memory.

Additionally, `KernelEmbed` in `kernel/hlir.rs` had an output indexing bug:
`out[out_offset * embed_dim + embed_idx]` should be `out[out_offset + embed_idx]` because
`out_offset` already includes the embed_dim factor from `flatten_strides`.

**Most critically**, the KernelEmbed and RowEmbed "with cast" egglog rules passed the
**pre-cast** float token_ids (`?token_ids`) to the embed kernel instead of the **post-cast**
int token_ids (`?token_ids_cast`). The CUDA kernel reads token_ids as `const int*`, so float
data gets reinterpreted as enormous garbage integers, causing out-of-bounds embed table access.

### Why it was hard to find

1. **Multiple independent bug sources**: The ~70% failure rate was caused by three separate bugs
   (matmul rank, embed output indexing, embed pre-cast input). Each fix only reduced the rate
   partially, making it seem like each fix was insufficient.
2. **CudaGraph wrapping**: The crash occurred inside `CudaGraphOp::execute_internal` which
   batches multiple kernels via CUDA graphs. The error just said "CudaGraph" — it
   didn't identify which kernel crashed. Adding per-kernel debug launches was essential.
3. **Cascading failures**: When the Megakernel (containing RowEmbed with the pre-cast bug)
   corrupted the embed output, the NEXT CudaGraph group's kernels crashed reading the garbage.
   This made the Megakernel appear to be the victim, not the source.
4. **The pre-cast bug only crashes SOMETIMES**: Egglog's random choice determines whether
   KernelEmbed/RowEmbed is selected (crash) or the generic Gather path is used (works).
   Float token_id 1.0 (= 0x3F800000 = 1065353216 as int) produces an astronomically large
   embed table index, causing ILLEGAL_ADDRESS.

### The fix

- Added `(= (len ?out_shape) 2)` to TileMatmulSplitK, TileMatmulFullSplit, and all 4 sgemm_v2 rules
- Fixed KernelEmbed output indexing: `out[out_offset + embed_idx]`
- **Fixed KernelEmbed/RowEmbed "with cast" rules**: Changed input from `?token_ids` to
  `?token_ids_cast` — using the post-Cast int tensor instead of the pre-Cast float tensor

### Results

Failure rate: ~70% → 0% (20/20 passing). All three bugs needed to be fixed together.

### General principle

**When an egglog rule matches a sub-expression chain (like Cast→Mul→Add), be precise about
which intermediate result becomes each input.** The "with cast" embed rules matched
`Cast(?token_ids, ...)` to verify the Cast existed, but then passed `?token_ids` (the Cast
INPUT) instead of `?token_ids_cast` (the Cast OUTPUT) to the embed kernel. The kernel expects
int data, so the pre-cast float data was reinterpreted as garbage ints.

**Always search for sibling implementations**: KernelEmbed (in `kernel/hlir.rs`) and RowEmbed
(in `block/ops.rs`) had the SAME bug in their "with cast" rules. Fixing one without the other
only reduces the failure rate — both must be fixed.

## 2026-03-09 — TileMatmulFullSplit Matches Element-wise Square+Sum from LayerNorm

### What the symptom was

`test_qwen_image_transformer_tiny` on CUDA produced NaN in specific output rows. The failure
was non-deterministic (~85% failure rate) due to egglog's random e-class extraction picking
TileMatmulFullSplit for some operations.

### What the actual root cause was

The `TileMatmulFullSplit` rewrite rule in `block/ops.rs` matched any `Mul + Sum` pattern with
a 2D output, contiguous K-strides, and F32 inputs. This correctly matched real matmuls, but
ALSO matched the element-wise `x * x + Sum(last_dim)` pattern from LayerNorm/RMSNorm
(Pow(x, 2) → ReduceMean).

For a [1, 4, 64] activation tensor `x`:
- `Mul(x, x)` shape: [1, 4, 64], strides: [256z, 64z, z] for both inputs
- `Sum(dim=2)` output: [1, 4], len=2 ✓

TileMatmulFullSplit interpreted this as a [1, 64] × [64, 4] → [1, 4] matmul with:
- A = row 0 of x (64 elements), B = same buffer at column offsets

The kernel computed `C[j] = sum_k x[k] * x[j*64+k]` (cross-products) instead of the correct
`C[j] = sum_k x[j*64+k]^2` (squared sums). This produced subtly wrong values for j > 0
(correct for j=0 since cross-product with self = squared sum). These wrong values propagated
through LayerNorm → downstream operations → softmax → NaN.

Key diagnostic: adding `printf` to the kernel showed `a_ptr == b_ptr` (same buffer for both
inputs), confirming the kernel was operating on `x * x` not a real matmul.

### Why it was hard to find

1. **Individual op tests passed**: Simple Gemm tests, attention tests, and all other bisection
   tests passed because they didn't have the specific `x*x → Sum` pattern.
2. **Non-deterministic**: The bug only manifested when egglog selected TileMatmulFullSplit
   over the kernel fallback for the square+sum operation.
3. **No NaN from TileMatmulFullSplit itself**: The kernel produced wrong-but-finite values.
   NaN only appeared downstream through softmax (exp(large) → ∞ → ∞/∞ = NaN).
4. **Systematic elimination needed**: Had to disable all block ops, then enable one at a time,
   to narrow down TileMatmulFullSplit as the culprit.

### The fix

Added matmul broadcast constraints to both `TileMatmulFullSplit` and `TileMatmulSplitK` rules:

```egglog
; Assert proper matmul broadcast pattern:
; A is broadcast over N (a_n_stride = 0), B is broadcast over M (b_m_stride = 0)
(= ?a_n_stride (MNum 0))
(= ?b_m_stride (MNum 0))
```

In a real matmul `[M, K] × [K, N]`, the Mul is created by expanding dims:
- A is broadcast over N → a_n_stride = 0
- B is broadcast over M → b_m_stride = 0

In element-wise `x * x`, both strides are identical (non-zero for all dims), so the
constraints correctly reject it. The cuBLAS `.egg` rules already had these constraints.

### General principle

**Matmul Mul+Sum patterns have specific broadcast structure: one input is broadcast over M
and the other over N.** When writing egglog rules that match `Mul + Sum` patterns for matmul
optimization, always verify the broadcast pattern (`a_n_stride = 0` and `b_m_stride = 0`).
This prevents matching element-wise operations like `x*x → sum` that happen to have a 2D
output and contiguous strides.

## 2026-03-09 — Conv3D Permute Axis Mismatch in ONNX Conv Parser

### Symptom

`test_qwen_image_vae_decoder_tiny` panicked with:
> Permute axes (5) doesn't match shape axes (6)

at `src/shape/tracker.rs:153`, during `parse_conv_node`.

### Root cause

The Conv parser's unfold → matmul algorithm used two consecutive permutes with incorrect
index calculations. After unfold produces a 2N-dimensional tensor
`[win_0..win_{N-1}, k_0..k_{N-1}]`, the first permute swapped kernel dims to the front.
But the second permute's index math still assumed the original (pre-first-permute) ordering,
confusing kernel dimensions with window dimensions. Additionally:

1. `output_spatial_dims` was captured from wrong indices (kernel dims instead of window
   spatial dims)
2. The `split_dims` loop iterated `spatial` times instead of `spatial-1`, creating a
   spurious size-1 dimension
3. The final permute array had `1+spatial` elements for a tensor with `2+spatial` dims

For Conv2D (spatial=2) this was never caught because the xfail'd VAE decoder test was the
only test exercising the Conv parser — the transformer tests don't use Conv ONNX nodes.

### Why it was hard to find

The Conv parser was written and the VAE test immediately xfail'd due to a *different* bug
(`merge_dims` being `todo!()`). Once `merge_dims` was implemented, the Conv parser's own
bugs surfaced for the first time.

### Fix

Rewrote the unfold → matmul section with a single correct permute:

1. **One permute** to `[N, win_spatial..., C_in, k_batch, k_chan, k_spatial...]`
   — groups batch | output spatial | channel+kernel
2. **Capture** `output_spatial_dims` from correct indices `[1..1+spatial]`
3. **Merge** all channel+kernel dims from the end into one
4. **Merge** spatial dims into one → `[N, spatial_product, C_in*kernel_product]`
5. **Matmul** → `[N, spatial_product, C_out]`
6. **Split** spatial back with `spatial-1` splits (not `spatial`)
7. **Permute** C_out to position 1 with correct `2+spatial` element array

### General principle

**When chaining permutes on high-dimensional tensors, prefer a single combined permute.**
Multiple permutes with hand-computed index arrays are error-prone because each permute
redefines what indices mean. A single permute from the original layout to the target layout
is easier to verify and less likely to confuse source/destination ordering. Also, ensure
`split_dims` loop counts match: splitting N dims out of a product requires N-1 splits
(the outermost dim is the quotient, not split out separately).

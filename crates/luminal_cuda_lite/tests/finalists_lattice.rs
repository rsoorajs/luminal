//! FINALISTS AND THE BUCKET LATTICE (Phase 5 of the #420/#422 rejoin),
//! CPU-side.
//!
//! The genetic search now keeps a RANKED list of genomes
//! (`CompileOptions::keep_finalists`), and what gets INSTALLED is chosen
//! by a best-first walk over the buckets' finalist ranks under one
//! aggregate constraint: `CompileOptions::device_budget_bytes` bounds the
//! arena slab the runtime will hold — `max` over the installed plans,
//! because the serving slab is grown once and sized to the largest of
//! them.
//!
//! The three things worth pinning:
//!
//!  * UNCONSTRAINED, NOTHING MOVES. With no budget the rank-1 finalist of
//!    every bucket passes its device warmup, the lattice reports zero
//!    rejections, and the installed plan is the search's own winner —
//!    which is why every pre-Phase-5 suite sees the trajectory it had.
//!  * A BUDGET NOTHING MEETS REFUSES BY NAME. The error carries the
//!    budget and the bytes that failed it, rather than a shrug.
//!
//! The fallback itself — a budget just under the winning set's slab
//! installs the cheapest one-coordinate-slower set that fits — is pinned
//! by the lattice's own unit tests over synthetic finalists
//! (`src/lattice.rs`), where the precondition (a runner-up with a
//! smaller slab) holds by construction. An end-to-end version depended
//! on the seeded genetic sample happening to contain such a runner-up
//! and re-rolled with every change to the e-graph's enumeration order.
//!
//! Candidate search and finalist validation run on the CUDA device.
//! Arena planning remains on the host, where `slab_bytes` is computed.

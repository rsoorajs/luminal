//!
//! Coverage:
//!  * the four contract forms on real device buffers (direct
//!    `device_call::dispatch` over hand-built `LtCall`s): the
//!    DEFAULT-epilogue forms under a ROW D and — RULING 2026-09-01,

//!  * the TF32 strictness detector assertion (contract 5);
//!  * a deliberate ld-bounds violation refused loudly BEFORE dispatch
//!    (contract 4 — including the rows==1 case the library's own check

//! M4 PHASE 5 GATE (c), `device` feature only: a REAL searched plan
//! elects a folded view on CUDA-lite, and the device output BYTE-MATCHES
//! the reference runtime's materialize-route output on identical inputs.
//!
//! Both sides run the full ladder from the same graph and data:
//!  * reference — its allow list is permanently materialize-only
//!    (ruling aff22598), so movement lowers to materialize kernels;
//!  * CUDA-lite — the view op is electable, the plan is ASSERTED to
//!    fold it (zero materialize computes + a consumer slot carrying
//!    composed access), and the kernel reads through the fold on
//!    device.
//!
//! Byte-match is the honest bar here: every fixture's arithmetic is
//! elementwise f32 mul and/or the serial per-output reduce loop, and
//! both executors accumulate in the same order over the same values —
//! IEEE-deterministic, so the routes must agree BIT-FOR-BIT, not just
//! within tolerance.

//! EXTREME AND NON-FINITE CONSTANT LITERALS UNDER NVRTC (`device`
//! feature only). The literal-emission fix (`kernels::cuda_f64_literal`)
//! is argued from the C grammar and pinned by host string tests; this
//! suite is the other half — the same values compiled by the REAL NVRTC
//! and executed on the REAL device, so "valid C token" is proven rather
//! than asserted.
//!
//! THE PATH THE LITERAL TAKES, in order:
//!
//!  1. `Graph::constant_f32(v)` (src/frontend/other.rs) records
//!     `LogicalOp::Constant(v as f64)`; the term's f64 child is written
//!     into the egglog program by `Graph`'s renderer as Rust's `{:?}`
//!     form — `-3.4028234663852886e38`, `-inf`, `NaN` — which the
//!     egglog parser accepts as f64 literals.
//!  2. `expand_rhs` records the broadcast view of that rank-0 constant,
//!     and the sum with a runtime input keeps the value opaque to any
//!     algebraic simplification: nothing in the graph can fold it away.
//!  3. Search elects this runtime's `ConstantDps`. Every test below
//!     ASSERTS the elected plan carries a `ConstantGeneric` compute
//!     node whose `value` BITS are the ones under test, so a plan that
//!     folded the constant away, or that reached codegen with some
//!     other number, fails loudly instead of passing vacuously. Steps
//!     1-3 were confirmed on a device-free host before this file
//!     landed: all four graphs plan, every elected op has a codegen
//!     row, and the plans carry `-3.4028234663852886e38`, `-inf` and
//!     `NaN` unchanged. Steps 4-5 are what only a device can settle.
//!  4. `ops::constant::codegen` formats the value through
//!     `kernels::cuda_f64_literal` into `out[i] = (float)<literal>;`.
//!  5. `execute()` hands that source to NVRTC. A literal that is not a
//!     C token fails to compile HERE (the pre-fix `-inf` / `NaN` and the
//!     39-digit integer-literal forms all did); a literal that compiles
//!     but denotes the wrong number shows up in the readback bits.
//!
//! CUMULATIVE MAX is the frontend-reachable witness: `GraphTensor::cummax`
//! seeds its window with `f32::MIN` (src/frontend/unary.rs), which `pad`
//! mints as exactly this constant (src/frontend/movement.rs `pad` ->
//! `constant_f32(elem)`). It runs here as a fourth case with a host
//! reference, so the motivating caller is covered end to end and not
//! only the synthetic constant.

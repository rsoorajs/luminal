//! CUDA-lite on the native ladder.
//!
//! The same six-method ladder as the reference `ReferenceRuntime`
//! (`load → bind_* → search → set_data → execute → get_*`), consuming
//! the same `BufferIrGraph` plans, claiming ops through the same
//! allow-list seam — but executing on a CUDA device with
//! NVRTC-compiled kernels instead of host loops.
//!
//! THE OP SET IS CHOSEN AT INITIALIZATION (ruling 2026-09-03, #420/#422
//! rejoin Phase 2): a runtime's matcher vocabulary and its derived allow
//! list come from the `Vec<RegisteredOp>` handed to
//! [`CudaRuntime::load_with_registry`] — [`cuda_registry`] (the DEFAULT:
//! every row this crate ships, cuBLASLt markers included since the
//! 2026-09-04 ruling) and [`cuda_registry_without_cublaslt`] (the
//! decomposed route on purpose) are the presets, and
//! [`cuda_registry_filtered`] narrows either without editing this crate.
//!
//! THIS CRATE OWNS ITS SEARCH (ruling 2026-09-03, #420/#422 rejoin
//! Phase 1): [`extractor`] and [`search`] are this runtime's own copies
//! — core keeps the shared machinery (program, assembly, `dps_rewrite`,
//! `decode_layout_table`, `bufferize`) and nothing that decides which
//! implementation wins. Candidates rank only by measured device time.
//! Host payloads are [`host_buffer::HostBuffer`],
//! not the reference runtime's `TypedBuffer`.
//!
//! Stage discipline (M4 kickoff ruling, 2026-08-17: "just focus on
//! getting cuda lite up and running"):
//! - CL-1: plan-level runtime + kernel codegen, buildable and testable
//!   everywhere; device execution behind the `device` feature.
//! - CL-2: bring-up on a real device; fidelity vs the reference over
//!   the mini battery.
//! - CL-3: CUDA-native ops (cuBLASLt first).
//! - CL-4: in-place ties (the Mutating family), views + resident
//!   geometry.
//! - CL-5 (#420/#422 rejoin Phase 4, 2026-09-03): PROFILING ON DEVICE,
//!   mirroring the reference evaluator's design —
//!   candidates are compiled, warmed and timed on the device ([`profile`]).
//!   Search requires the `device` feature and a CUDA GPU.
//! - CL-6 (#420/#422 rejoin Phase 5, 2026-09-03): FINALISTS AND THE
//!   BUCKET LATTICE ([`finalists`], [`lattice`]). The search keeps a
//!   ranked list of genomes and the plan that gets INSTALLED is chosen by
//!   a best-first walk over the buckets' finalist ranks under one
//!   aggregate constraint — `CompileOptions::device_budget_bytes` bounds
//!   the arena slab the runtime will hold. Unconstrained (the default)
//!   the walk installs the search's own winner and costs nothing.
//!
//! Execution always launches CUDA graphs. Owned kernels and copies are parent
//! graph nodes; HostOps prepare library calls and capture opaque child graphs.
//! Dynamic dimensions live in an arena-resident parameter block. Buckets overlay
//! one capacity-sized arena, including boundary device copies and host-op scratch.
//! Input staging and output readback are graph nodes backed by one shared pinned
//! host allocation. Returned outputs own their host bytes.
//!
//! Bufferization supplies alias/lifetime contracts and dependency edges. The
//! arena preserves them in a serial issue order; generated kernels must fully
//! initialize their destinations, since temporary ranges are reused without
//! clearing. cuBLASLt's accumulate forms follow their declared alias contracts.

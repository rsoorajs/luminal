//! HOST PAYLOADS for this runtime: bytes plus a dtype tag.
//!
//! CL DOES NOT USE `TypedBuffer` (ruling D4, 2026-09-03: "put
//! TypedBuffer in luminal_reference. CL shouldn't use it for tests").
//! That type is the REFERENCE executor's storage — a sum over eleven
//! `Vec<T>` variants, because its kernels read and write typed Rust
//! slices. This runtime's kernels run on a device: everything staged
//! here is about to become an H2D copy, and everything read back here
//! just came from a D2H copy. Bytes plus the dtype the plan says the
//! buffer holds is the whole of what this side needs, and it makes the
//! device bridge (`crate::device`) a memcpy instead of a match.
//!
//! DIFFERENTIAL TESTS stage BOTH: the CL side of a test builds
//! `HostBuffer`s, the reference side builds
//! `luminal_reference::TypedBuffer`s. Two runtimes, two payload types,
//! one set of numbers to compare — which is the point of the split, not
//! a hole in it.

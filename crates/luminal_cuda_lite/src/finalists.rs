//! FINALISTS — the ranked genomes of ONE bucket, re-materialized lazily
//! under a hard filter.
//!
//! PHASE 5 OF THE #420/#422 REJOIN (2026-09-03), the "then add" half of
//! Austin's D8 (*"defer temporarily, but then add"*): Phase 4 landed the
//! device evaluator and explicitly deferred main's `Finalists` /
//! `BucketLattice` pair. This is that pair, re-expressed for this
//! branch.
//!
//! # What a finalist is, and why the GA's winner is not simply installed
//!
//! The genetic search ([`crate::search::search_implementations`]) ranks
//! candidates and today hands back exactly one — the fastest. That is
//! enough while nothing can REFUSE the winner after the fact. The moment
//! a constraint applies to the INSTALLED plan rather than to a candidate
//! in isolation — a device budget the serving slab must fit inside, a
//! warmup that has to survive — the search needs a runner-up to fall
//! back to, and the one after that.
//!
//! So the GA now keeps a RANKED LIST (`CompileOptions::keep_finalists`,
//! default 4) of `(metric, Genome)` pairs, fastest first, and this type
//! turns them into deployment plans ONE AT A TIME. Rank k is extracted,
//! DPS-rewritten, layout-decoded, bufferized and arena-planned only when
//! the selection actually reaches it (main's own words: "extract a full
//! graph only when the selection reaches its rank"). A refusal at ANY of
//! those steps is a rejection with a recorded reason, and the walk moves
//! to rank k+1.
//!
//! # The hard filter
//!
//! `ensure(target, validate)` is the door. `validate` is the RUNTIME's
//! (see [`crate::search::finalist_validate`]): it runs one warmup execution
//! of the candidate plan on the device before installation.
//!
//! # What is NOT here (main's version, minus LLIR)
//!
//! Main's `Finalists` carries `pre_unroll` graphs, the `LLIR_DUMP_DIR` /
//! `LLIR_DUMP_PRE_UNROLL` dump machinery, and a `search_time_limit` /
//! `candidate_timeout` clock over the finalization itself. This branch
//! has no LLIR and no loop unrolling, so the dumps and the pre-unroll
//! field have nothing to dump; and its one timeout
//! (`CompileOptions::candidate_timeout`) is documented to cover a TIMED
//! DEVICE RUN and nothing else (Phase 4's ruling, *"timeout should just
//! cover run"*), so it is not re-purposed here as a finalization budget.
//! Re-extraction on this branch is a host-side graph walk, not a search.

//! The cuBLASLt HOST-CALL contract layer — CPU-side, device-free.
//!
//! Train 3 (registry + host-call dispatch): the four marker contracts
//! execute as ONE host library call (`cublasLtMatmul`), not an NVRTC
//! kernel. This module turns an elected [`CublasLt`] op (its parsed
//! [`LtMatmulSpec`]) into a fully-resolved [`LtCall`] — plain numerics
//! and finite classifications only — and carries the executor-side
//! validation the library itself does NOT provide. Everything here is
//! unit-testable without a device; the cudarc dispatch lives in
//! `device_call` (feature-gated) and consumes an `LtCall` verbatim.
//!
//! THE A100 EXECUTOR CONTRACTS (verified findings; load-bearing):
//! 1. F32-only end to end (inputs, outputs, CUBLAS_COMPUTE_32F).
//! 2. POINTER_MODE_HOST with LITERAL scalars: alpha = 1.0f always
//!    (the marker has no alpha channel); beta is STRUCTURAL — 1.0f on
//!    the C-fold (Accumulate) forms, 0.0f otherwise. There is no
//!    runtime scalar channel: [`LtCall`] has NO alpha/beta float
//!    fields, only [`LtCall::beta_is_one`], and the literals live in
//!    the dispatch site as compile-time constants.
//! 3. C = D aliasing with a VALID Cdesc on the no-C forms
//!    (Cdesc = NULL segfaults): [`LtCall::c`] is NON-OPTIONAL — every
//!    call carries a C descriptor; [`CSource::AliasD`] says "pass the
//!    D pointer" and beta = 0.0f guarantees C is never read.
//! 4. ld semantics: the library's own ld check is self-consistency
//!    only and VACUOUS at rows == 1 (in ROW order a single row never
//!    dereferences ld) — [`validate_ld_bounds`] is the REAL bounds
//!    validation (`ld*(rows-1) + cols <= element count` in ROW order),
//!    asserted loudly at dispatch for A, B, C, and D. Emitted lds are
//!    clamped to `>= 1` at plan time.
//! 5. TF32 is graph-modeled, never a flag: the dispatch sets
//!    CUBLAS_COMPUTE_32F explicitly and `device_call` carries a
//!    startup detector assertion at handle creation.
//!
//! THE ROW CONVENTION (Train-3 orientation fix; measured on the A100
//! with the 4x8x3 dump — see `tests/cublaslt_contracts.rs`):
//! every emitted layout descriptor DECLARES its order explicitly —
//! never the library's COL default, and (since the destination-frame
//! fix below) never a constant at the dispatch site either. The order
//! is a field of [`LtDesc`]. A and B are ROW; C and D are whatever the
//! plan's elected destination layout resolves to. This DECLARES
//! REALITY, in two halves:
//!
//!  * A and B: the marker spec's readings are COL views over the
//!    operand buffers' bytes (frozen estate convention R9/R10). A COL
//!    `r x c / ld` view of a byte range IS the ROW `c x r / ld` view
//!    of the transposed matrix — same bytes, same pitch — so the
//!    bridge re-expresses each operand reading as ROW by swapping the
//!    descriptor dims and FLIPPING the transpose op. The spec's lds
//!    carry over verbatim (a COL view's ld and the underlying
//!    row-major storage's row pitch are the same number, padded
//!    layouts included).
//!  * D (and C, which rides D's layout by rule guard): the PLAN'S
//!    disclosed destination layout is authoritative. What is NOT
//!    authoritative is the spec's ldd/ldc — those describe the CLAIMED
//!    e-graph layout over the RECORDER's out buffer, a buffer the
//!    executor never writes, and consuming them was the orientation
//!    bug: bytes landed COL-major at the spec's pitch while the
//!    disclosure read row-major (element 0 agreed, element 1 did not).
//!    The bridge therefore builds the D FRAME from the call
//!    (`m x n`) and takes its ORDER from the destination value's
//!    elected layout via [`bind_destination`] — ROW `ld = n` for a
//!    right-major election, COL `ld = m` for a left-major one.
//!    Hardcoding ROW here instead was the second orientation failure;
//!    see the note below.
//!
//! The CM-swap alternative (compute D^T with swapped roles under COL
//! defaults) is REJECTED: cuBLASLt's bias epilogue adds bias[i] to
//! row i of the API's D, and the marker's bias contract is per-row of
//! the call's D (length m) — a role swap would silently turn it into
//! a per-column bias.
//!
//! THE BIAS FORMS DISPATCH ONLY UNDER A COL-ORDER D (ruling 2026-09-01,
//! Austin: "adding the layout requirement to the rule is the correct
//! solution"). MEASURED on the A100 (2026-08-28): the library returns
//! CUBLAS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED for CUBLASLT_EPILOGUE_BIAS / RELU_BIAS
//! whenever D is CUBLASLT_ORDER_ROW (any A/B order). The fix is in the
//! ESTATE, not here: the two bias decorators
//! (`egg/cublaslt_marker_decorate.egg`) now carry the premise
//! `(= ?inner_L (LeftMajorContiguousElementLayoutLit ?ishape ?d_bits2))`
//! — the bias form is minted only when the claimed D is provably
//! left-major contiguous over the sibling frame `[n, m]`, which is
//! byte-identical to the recorder's row-major `[m, n]`, puts the
//! per-feature vector on D's rows (the API's only bias axis), and is
//! exactly what [`bind_destination`] resolves to `LtDesc::col`.
//!
//! THE FENCE IS THE SAME QUESTION, ASKED OF THE CLASS.
//! [`bind_destination`] binds a bias form's D by
//! `dest.require::<LeftMajorContiguousElementLayout>(who)` — the
//! decorator's premise, spelled at the call site. A destination class
//! that holds the LeftMajor spelling binds COL; one that does not is
//! unreachable from the estate and is refused before any descriptor
//! exists. The degenerate-extent coincidence — at `m == 1` or `n == 1`
//! the right-major and left-major contiguous index maps over `[m, n]`
//! are the SAME function, so the e-graph puts BOTH literals in one
//! class — is NOT a case here: the class carries both spellings and
//! `require` reads the class, not one chosen spelling. (It was a case
//! only while a preference-ordered decoder handed this bridge one
//! spelling of that class and hid the other; that decoder is gone.)
//!
//! THE DESTINATION FRAME IS THE PLAN'S, NOT A CONSTANT (regression fix,
//! 2026-08-31 — see [`bind_destination`]). The paragraph above says
//! "the executor materializes every result DENSE ROW-MAJOR in the
//! value's own dims (the disclosure downstream walks exactly that)".
//! Under Option B that second clause STOPPED BEING TRUE: the plan
//! carries each value's ELECTED layout and every consumer — the
//! codegen read path, the output-slot disclosure, `dense_f32` — reads
//! through it, so "dense row-major" is no longer a law the executor
//! may assume. On the marker's own transpose-sandwich the elected
//! destination layout is LEFT-major: the site that dispatches is the
//! SIBLING (D' = B^T A^T = out^T, an `m' x n'` frame), and the e-graph
//! elects for that sibling value exactly the layout that makes the
//! ORIGINAL out right-major over the same bytes — `LeftMajor[m', n']`.
//! Writing ROW there produced an exact product in transposed byte
//! order: the SAME failure shape as the original orientation bug, one
//! convention further along.
//!
//! So the destination ORDER is resolved against the plan, not assumed:
//! [`LtOrder`] is a field of every [`LtDesc`], `plan_call` emits the
//! spec-only DEFAULT (ROW), and the executor calls [`bind_destination`]
//! with the result slot's elected layout before dispatch.

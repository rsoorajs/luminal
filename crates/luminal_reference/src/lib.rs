//! The reference runtime: the trusted, loud, out-of-place host
//! executor every other runtime is measured against — now a
//! standalone crate (Step B, ruling 2026-08-17). The core crate is
//! runtime-neutral; everything reference-flavored lives here: the
//! runtime and its ladder, the op registry (structs, matchers,
//! snippets, kernels), and the defaulting conveniences that assume
//! this registry.
//!
//! POST-SATURATION SELECTION IS OURS ([`search`]): the op registry, the
//! allow list, the host-timing evaluator, the option knobs, the outcome
//! shape and the GA loop that runs them. What decides nothing — the
//! e-graph walk and the genome sampler — is core's
//! (`luminal::extraction`, `luminal::search_support`), and [`extractor`]
//! below is this crate's name for the walk (#420/#422 rejoin Phase 8,
//! 2026-09-04; it was a verbatim copy here through Phases 1-7).
